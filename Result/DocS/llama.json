However, the computer shut down the wheels due to excess current. The issue needs to be resolved within two to three weeks.\n\nNASA's Ames Research Center developed the spacecraft, which will study the lunar atmosphere and dust. It was launched aboard an unmanned Minotaur rocket from Virginia's Eastern Shore.\n\nThe launch provided a rare light show along the East Coast for those with clear skies. NASA encouraged sky watchers to share their photos on Flickr, and many responded with pictures and reports from various locations.\n\nLADEE will take a month-long journey to the moon, making three huge laps around Earth before entering lunar orbit. The $280 million mission will last six months and end with LADEE crashing into the moon.\n\nScientists aim to learn more about the moon's atmosphere and whether dust levitates from its surface. The spacecraft is equipped with science instruments and laser communication test equipment that could revolutionize data relay.\n\nNASA chose Wallops for the launch due to the Minotaur V rocket, which was comprised of converted intercontinental ballistic missile motors. This was Wallops' first deep-space liftoff, and it will be back in the spotlight soon with another commercial launch scheduled for September 17."

They think teaching kids ways to avoid violence and giving them access to mental health services could help.\n\nBut progress has been slow because there isn't enough money, some safety programs haven't worked, and teachers and students haven't been properly trained.\n\nA new study from Vanderbilt University found that teaching younger kids how to resolve conflicts could be very effective. The study looked at 27 school safety programs and talked to kids who had been victims of violence.\n\nThe researcher, Manny Sethi, said it's hard to change behavior in older kids. He thinks problem-solving skills should be taught before high school.\n\nBeverly Kingston from the University of Colorado agrees. She said social-emotional learning programs should start in preschool.\n\nAfter a mass stabbing at Franklin Regional High School, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett emphasized the need for better mental health services. But mental health professionals say funding cuts have led to fewer counselors and psychologists in schools.\n\nJulia Szarko from the Association of School Psychologists in Pennsylvania said schools are the first line of defense for mental health support, but they don't have enough staff.\n\nSteven Berkowitz from the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry said politicians often promise to deal with mental health issues after school tragedies, but don't follow through with legislation or funding.\n\nU.S. Representative Tim Murphy has proposed a bill to improve access to psychiatric care by integrating it into primary care and pediatric practices.\n\nSchools have tried many ways to stay safe, including anti-bullying programs and metal detectors. But some of these methods haven't worked.\n\nA pilot program in a Nashville middle school taught kids how to avoid violence through role-playing exercises. The students reported feeling less likely to be bullied or violent after the program.\n\nEven if schools identify troubled students, they often don't get consistent help. John Matthews from the Community Safety Institute said this was the case with Seung-Hui Cho, who killed 32 people at Virginia Tech in 2007.\n\nMatthews said schools need to tailor their safety plans to their campuses and train staff and students properly. Alicia Chico, a social worker, said teachers are often too busy to deal with these issues.\n\nCirecie West-Olatunji from the American Counseling Association agreed that more training is needed for teachers and mental health professionals."

He says that the key is training and proper instruction, just like any tool.\n\nJensen watched a video of the fatal lesson and said that it was clear that the girl was a beginner and shouldn't have been given such a powerful weapon to use. He compared it to learning how to drive an Indy car, saying you don't start with that type of vehicle.\n\nThe Arizona Division of Occupational Safety and Health is investigating the incident, and the Mohave County Sheriff's Office has said it will not file charges.\n\nJensen's range does not allow full automatic fire and does not rent firearms. Children under 16 must be supervised by a legal guardian or parent, but those adults do not need to be certified instructors.\n\nBlake Carrington, who serves in the Air Force, has taught his 10-year-old daughter to shoot a .22 rifle. He said he would never give his child a fully automatic weapon and feels terrible for the girl involved in the incident.\n\nCarrington is torn about whether gun access laws should be stricter for children. He believes that guns will do what humans tell them to do, but poor decision-making can lead to accidents.\n\nFederal law prohibits children under 18 from possessing a firearm, but there is no federal law preventing children's access to guns. Arizona is one of 21 states with no law restricting gun access to children under 18 as long as there is adult supervision.\n\nLindsey Zwicker, staff attorney with the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said that currently, 28 states and the District of Columbia have laws governing children's access to firearms. She believes that when incidents like this happen, people start talking about weaknesses in the law and discussing ways to prevent it from happening again.\n\nTom, a gun enthusiast, worries that the fatal accident will be used by gun control activists to push for stricter laws. He believes that kids should not be kept away from firearms and that this incident should not stop people from taking their kids to shooting ranges.\n\nSean Yeandle, an instructor at Marksman Pistol Institute I, said he has never seen anyone under 21 shoot an Uzi at his range. He believes that children under 18 should not use such a weapon due to the risk involved."

But Tuesday's election was not a clear victory for protesters who wanted change.\n\nThe most significant result is that 30% of registered voters cast ballots - more than double the typical turnout. However, two candidates supported by protesters did not win.\n\nBob Hudgins lost to former Mayor Brian Fletcher in the 2nd Ward. Lee Smith lost to Wesley Bell in the 3rd Ward. Both Hudgins and Smith were backed by a coalition of groups who wanted reform.\n\nPatricia Bynes managed their campaigns. Ferguson's population is 67% black, but only one council seat was held by an African American before Tuesday.\n\nElla Jones won nearly 50% of the vote in the 1st Ward. She raised more money than her opponents and had a $7,000 donation from the Communication Workers of America. Jones started campaigning long before Michael Brown's death and said she ran because of how police treated young black men.\n\nIn previous years, candidates often ran uncontested, and turnout was low. But after the protests and federal investigations, eight candidates ran for three council seats, attracting national media attention.\n\nOn election day, a thunderstorm rolled in as voters headed to the polls. Despite this, many people still voted, including Sharon Bell-Price, who said she never misses an opportunity to vote. She said that the turmoil and tension in Ferguson made this election extremely important.\n\nThe results showed that voter turnout was higher than normal, but it didn't favor the protesters' candidates. The rain may have helped the establishment candidates instead.\n\nWesley Bell's status as a municipal court judge didn't seem to hurt him. His campaign manager said that knocking on doors and talking to people in person was key to his victory.\n\nThe next council will face significant challenges, including the aftermath of the Department of Justice investigation into the police department's civil rights violations and acting as a collection agency for Ferguson's municipal courts."

A recent study found that growing up poor can hurt brain development and lead to lower grades in school.\n\nIt has long been known that low socioeconomic status affects how well children do in school. Recent research also shows that poverty can affect brain size. This new study looked at how much of the difference in academic achievement between high- and low-income kids is due to differences in brain development. \n\nThe researchers studied 389 healthy children and teenagers from age 4 to 22, comparing their test scores with the volume of tissue in certain areas of the brain. These areas are important for learning and can be affected by a person's early environment.\n\nThey found that children who grew up below the poverty line had less gray matter in these brain areas than normal. They also found that having more money doesn't necessarily mean better outcomes, but at a certain point, not having enough money hurts development. The researchers excluded kids with other factors known to affect brain development, such as family history of mental illness or a difficult pregnancy.\n\nThe study's results were clear: low socioeconomic status affects brain development even in otherwise healthy kids. A recent report found that 51 percent of students in U.S. public schools are from low-income families and are exposed to more stressors like less access to healthy food, unsafe neighborhoods, and stressed parents. The researchers hope to find ways to help children who grow up poor by studying the effects of social programs like free lunch or housing vouchers."

The Metro-North train was traveling from Poughkeepsie to Manhattan when it went off the rails at about 7:20 a.m.\n\nThe crash happened on a curve in the Bronx where the Hudson and Harlem rivers meet. Some passengers were thrown from the toppling cars, and others were trapped inside. \n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that 11 of those injured are in critical condition and another six are seriously hurt. He also announced that the train operator was among the injured.\n\nCuomo said that it appears speed may have been a factor in the crash. The speed limit on the curve where the derailment happened is 30 mph, but Cuomo said the investigation will determine how fast the train was going.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the cause of the crash. They will look at factors including the train, track and signal system, operators, and speed.\n\nOne passenger told a local news station that the train seemed to be going \"a lot faster\" than usual as it approached the curve near the Spuyten Duyvil station. \n\nAnother passenger said he was dozing off when the car started rolling several times. He then saw gravel coming at him and heard people screaming.\n\nNearby residents reported hearing a loud boom, with one resident saying that he thought it was a plane crash. Emergency crews arrived quickly and carried passengers away on stretchers.\n\nThe MTA has identified three men and one woman as the victims of the derailment. The names have not been released yet.\n\nThe NTSB has been urging railroads to install technology that can stop derailing caused by excessive speed since 2008, but it's expensive and complicated.\n\nMetro-North is in the process of installing this technology, which uses GPS, wireless radio, and computers to monitor trains. However, it's not clear if the system would have prevented Sunday's accident.\n\nSunday's derailment was the second passenger train derailment in six months for Metro-North. In May, an eastbound train derailed in Bridgeport, Conn., and was struck by a westbound train, injuring 73 passengers and three crew members."

But when pale sores appeared on his body and he lost feeling in his fingertips, a doctor told him he had leprosy.\n\nYadav has lived in Kasturba Gram, a leper colony outside New Delhi, since his diagnosis 30 years ago. The stigma of leprosy continues in India, even though the country has made progress against the disease. Leprosy is not highly contagious or fatal, but people still fear it.\n\nThe number of new cases rose slightly after years of decline. Medical experts say this is because people are afraid to get diagnosed and treated. People with leprosy face many problems, including losing their jobs and being shunned by their families.\n\nNeelawati Devi, a resident of Kasturba Gram, said, \"We face many indignities every day.\" She wants her children to get an education and find jobs without the stigma of leprosy affecting them.\n\nPublic health centers are trying to educate people that leprosy is not contagious through normal contact. Leprosy is curable with antibiotics, and most people have a natural immunity. However, the deformities caused by leprosy contribute to the fear surrounding it.\n\nIndia declared victory over leprosy in 2005, but some areas still have problems with the disease. The health ministry reported 134,752 new cases of leprosy in 2012-2013, slightly more than the previous year. India accounts for 58% of newly diagnosed leprosy cases worldwide.\n\nActivists disagree about why the number of cases rose. Some say it's because of an intensified campaign against leprosy, while others believe that resources were reassigned to other causes after India declared victory in 2005.\n\nThe government is increasing its efforts to fight leprosy, but patients and their families still face pain and stigma. G. Venugopal, a resident of Kasturba Gram, said, \"Our children shouldn't have the shadow of leprosy hanging over their lives.\"\n\nP.K. Gopal, who has worked with leprosy patients for over 40 years, said that changing people's attitudes takes time. The fear of leprosy prevents people from seeking treatment, which affects the success of the leprosy program.\n\nResidents of Kasturba Gram are lobbying the government to increase disability allowances for leprosy survivors. They currently receive a monthly allowance of 1,800 rupees ($29), which is not enough to cover their expenses.\n\nUttam Kumar, another resident, was thrown out of his home because of his leprosy diagnosis.

When the monsoon rains came each year, the rivers would flood and ruin their crops. They had no safety net or insurance to protect themselves against losses.\n\nThese farmers don't have access to better seeds, fertilizer, or irrigation systems like farmers in rich countries do. One bad event, like a drought or flood, can make them even poorer and hungrier.\n\nNow, climate change is making things worse for these farmers. Rising temperatures will disrupt agriculture, especially in tropical areas. Crops won't grow due to too little or too much rain, and pests will thrive in the warmer climate.\n\nFarmers in wealthier countries have tools and support to manage these risks, but poor farmers don't. They need our help to feed a growing population. By 2050, global food demand is expected to increase by 60%. Declining harvests would strain the global food system, increasing hunger and poverty.\n\nI'm optimistic that we can avoid the worst impacts of climate change and feed the world if we act now. Governments need to invest in clean-energy innovations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We also need to help poor farmers adapt to a changing climate with basic tools like financing, better seeds, fertilizer, training, and markets.\n\nThe Gates Foundation has developed new varieties of seeds that can grow during droughts or floods. These efforts can transform lives, doubling or tripling harvests and incomes. This allows farmers to improve their diets, invest in their farms, and send their children to school.\n\nThere will be unforeseen threats from climate change, so we need to accelerate research into seeds and supports for smallholder farmers. Satellite technology is helping farmers in Africa by creating detailed soil maps that inform them about what plant varieties will thrive on their land.\n\nTo transform the lives of farming families, we need to get these solutions into their hands. Organizations like One Acre Fund are working with African farmers, providing access to financing, tools, and training.\n\nI believe that Africa can feed itself in the next 15 years, even with the risks of climate change. Poor farmers have it tough, but I know they can overcome the challenges they face today and tomorrow with our help."

Even in developing countries, the number of overweight kids has increased significantly.\n\nBeing overweight can lead to serious health problems like heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that being overweight increases a person's risk of these conditions.\n\nResearchers looked at data from 183 countries between 1980 and 2013. They found that the number of people who are overweight or obese has increased significantly in almost every country. Tonga had the highest percentage of adults considered obese, followed by Kuwait, Kiribati, Micronesia, Libya, Qatar, and Samoa.\n\nThe United States also had a high rate of obesity, with about 1/3 of men and women considered obese. The researchers noted that 13% of the world's obese individuals live in the US, more than any other country.\n\nMore than half of the world's obese people live in just 10 countries: the US, China, India, Russia, Brazil, Mexico, Egypt, Germany, Pakistan, and Indonesia. These countries have large populations, so even with relatively low rates of obesity, they still have a lot of obese individuals.\n\nThe report found that no country has seen a significant decrease in obesity over the past 33 years. This is despite public health efforts to reduce smoking and improve diets, which have led to decreases in deaths from heart disease and other conditions.\n\nEpidemiologist Klim McPherson wrote in a commentary accompanying the study that it's unclear when or if there will be a similar success with weight loss.

The government is under pressure to do something about it.\n\nRecently, the Chinese government proposed new rules that would ban indoor smoking and limit cigarette advertising. But these proposals are being opposed by the powerful tobacco industry, which brings a lot of money into the government's treasury.\n\nOne woman who has been at the forefront of this fight is Yang Gonghuan, a professor of medicine at Beijing University. She has spent her career studying the effects of smoking on health and advocating for stronger anti-smoking laws.\n\nYang says that attitudes towards smoking are starting to change in China, with more people recognizing the harm it causes. But she also acknowledges that the tobacco industry is very powerful and will not give up easily.\n\nThe new rules proposed by the government would ban indoor smoking, require larger warning labels on cigarette packs, and limit advertising. They would also make private businesses responsible for enforcing the ban, subject to fines if they don't comply.\n\nBut the tobacco industry is fighting back, with some officials arguing that the proposals go too far. They say that smokers have a right to smoke in public places and that the government should not interfere.\n\nThe debate over tobacco control in China is complex, with different groups having different opinions on what should be done. But one thing is clear: something needs to be done to address the country's massive smoking problem.\n\nIn recent years, there has been growing awareness about the dangers of smoking in China, and more people are starting to speak out against it. The government has also started to take action, with some cities introducing their own anti-smoking laws.\n\nBut the tobacco industry remains powerful, and it will likely take a long time for attitudes towards smoking to change completely. Still, advocates like Yang Gonghuan remain optimistic that eventually, China will join other countries in taking strong action against smoking.\n\nThe proposed regulations are expected to be finalized soon, and if they are enacted, they could have a major impact on public health in China. The government has said that it is committed to reducing the number of smokers in the country and improving public health.\n\nBut the fight against tobacco is not just about laws and regulations - it's also about changing attitudes towards smoking. In China, smoking is still seen as a normal part of life by many people, and it will take time and effort to change this.\n\nStill, there are signs that attitudes are starting to shift. More and more Chinese people are becoming aware of the dangers of smoking, and some cities have already introduced their own anti-smoking laws.\n\nThe fight against tobacco in China is complex and challenging, but advocates like Yang Gonghuan remain committed to the cause. They believe that with time and effort, it's possible to reduce the number of smokers in the country and improve public health.\n\nIn the end, the outcome of this battle will depend on a variety of factors, including the strength of the tobacco industry and the willingness of the government to take action. But one thing is clear: something needs to be done to address China's massive smoking problem, and soon."

National security efforts are usually about protecting the country from threats like terrorism or other countries' aggression.\n\nHelping West Africa with Ebola is actually a humanitarian mission, not a national security issue. The U.S. military is good at doing these kinds of missions, and they have done them many times before, both in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nThe right way to decide if a mission like this is a good idea is to ask if it's suitable, feasible, and acceptable. In this case, sending troops to West Africa meets all those criteria. The Pentagon can quickly send experts, support, and equipment to help fight Ebola.\n\n**CON: Sending Troops to Fight Ebola Is Unfair**\n\nPresident Obama is using American troops to show the world he cares about fighting Ebola, but this plan has many problems. Our military is already stretched too thin and can't handle another big mission.\n\nThe Army is being cut from 570,000 soldiers to 440,000, which will make it harder to respond to multiple crises at once. Sending troops to West Africa could lead to a quagmire, where they get stuck in a situation that's hard to get out of.\n\nMaintaining order in countries with Ebola outbreaks will be difficult and may require a bigger U.S. commitment than planned. This could put our soldiers in situations where they have to choose between their safety and the public's, which is unfair.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control (CDC) isn't ready to handle the risks of sending troops to fight Ebola, and militarizing humanitarian aid can lead to involvement in internal disputes in unstable countries.\n\nOverall, sending U.S. troops to fight Ebola puts them at enormous risk and may not be the best way to help."

This \"library\" contains information about thousands of unique molecules, which can be searched through by crime-scene investigators and researchers around the world.\n\nThe university hopes to fund the Max A. Weaver Dye Library with a $785,000 grant from the National Institute of Justice. The library is part of N.C. State's efforts in forensic science research. It will help forensic investigators find the sources of dyed fibers from clothing or other materials like car interiors and furniture.\n\nThe idea behind the library was to create a powerful tool for forensic investigators. It will be similar to a database of automotive paints started by Canadian law enforcement officials. The library will also be open to all researchers and is expected to become an important tool for scientists working in many areas, including chemistry, medicine, and engineering.\n\nSome of the dyes could be used to develop camouflage that's more effective in darkness or to create more efficient solar panels. They may also be used to treat cancer by tinting cancer cells so surgeons can see them better. The collection was donated by Eastman after Professor David Hinks found himself at a formal lunch with Stewart Witzeman, then director of Eastman's research division.\n\nThe library is housed at N.C. State's College of Textiles on Centennial Campus. Undergraduate students have begun digitizing each dye molecule and putting the information into a database that can be searched by chemical compounds or fragments of compounds and other attributes. The ability to search by component will make it easier to find dyes with desired characteristics.\n\nThe library of molecule structures will be open and free, but N.C. State might charge a membership for access to all but forensic investigators for the rest of the data. Once it's all published online, the long-term plan is to have it grow by approaching other chemical companies to see if they have any dyes in storage they're willing to donate.\n\nThe collection represents the life's work of Max Weaver, a chemist who worked for Eastman for 29 years and was known for being meticulous in his methods of storage and documentation. He created the single largest portion of the dye library, though more than a dozen other chemists also contributed. Now, once it's online, their work will become all but permanently preserved."

This suggests that Mars once had a thick layer of insulation in its atmosphere, which has since disappeared. NASA's MAVEN spacecraft, which arrived at Mars on Sunday evening (Sept. 21), aims to solve this mystery.\n\n\"One of the biggest questions about Mars is whether there was ever life,\" said Bruce Jakosky, principal investigator for MAVEN. Life would have required liquid water. To learn more about the history of Mars' habitability, MAVEN will study its atmosphere now and try to understand what it might once have been like and how it was lost.\n\nMAVEN has been traveling towards Mars since November 2013. On Sunday night, the spacecraft completed a difficult trajectory maneuver that allowed Mars's gravity to capture it in orbit. Over the next six weeks, MAVEN will gradually lose altitude and its eight instruments will undergo checks before taking science measurements in November.\n\nIf all goes well, MAVEN scientists hope to work with researchers behind India's Mars Orbiter Mission, which is due to arrive in orbit just three days after MAVEN on Sept. 24. The Indian mission will take a broader approach, imaging and characterizing the planet's surface and atmosphere. NASA and India are interested in cooperating and correlating data sets.\n\nScientists have two main theories about how the bulk of Mars' atmosphere escaped: it could have seeped down through the surface to the planet's crust or floated up and been lost to space. MAVEN will watch to see when and how gas is currently stripped off the top of the atmosphere, which is thought to be driven by interactions with the solar wind.\n\nMAVEN will also get a bonus in the form of comet C/2013 A1, which will cruise to within 130,000 kilometers of Mars on Oct. 19.

A researcher from Macquarie University in Australia studied recent extinctions among reptiles and amphibians. The results are alarming. About 200 frog species have gone extinct, and hundreds more may be on their way out.\n\nThe researcher used a statistical method to estimate the probability of past extinctions for certain types of amphibians and reptiles. He found that frogs seemed to be the most vulnerable to extinction. More than 3 percent of all frog species have disappeared, mostly since the 1970s.\n\nThis is a worrisome finding, especially since the researcher describes his method as highly conservative, meaning it's likely to underestimate the number of extinctions. The results also predict that if these extinction rates keep up, nearly 7 percent of frogs could be lost in the next century.\n\nThe data suggest that extinction rates for reptiles and amphibians are about 10,000 times larger than the rates for all other organisms. Frogs are a particularly vulnerable group, often suffering large population losses more easily than other groups.\n\nThe researcher found extinctions in Central America, Brazil, Madagascar, and New Guinea - places where there are not well-documented population losses due to anything. It's unclear what's been causing these extinctions, which seem to have accelerated in the past several decades.\n\nA variety of factors could be at play, including habitat destruction and a deadly fungus called Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. There wasn't a clear pattern between environmental pressures and extinctions.\n\nFuture research should include more field work to figure out the environmental pressures that are causing extinctions in different locations. Then scientists might be able to start taking action to cut down on the losses.\n\nThe researcher notes that it's important for scientists to look at the broad range of environmental factors that might be affecting an animal, not just climate change.

Relatives of those killed are angry about the sentence and many question the defense strategy. A psychologist testified in court that Couch had “affluenza” because he grew up in a wealthy family and didn’t know right from wrong. The psychologist said this meant Couch shouldn’t receive the maximum 20-year prison sentence.\n\nBut Dr. Gary Buffone, a psychologist who works with wealthy families, says the term wasn’t meant to be used as an excuse for bad behavior. He calls it “just being a spoiled brat.” Buffone also says that by giving Couch such a light sentence, the judge is essentially saying that wealth can get you out of trouble.\n\nCouch was driving drunk when he killed four people in June. Prosecutors argued that if Couch continues to be protected by his family’s wealth, another tragedy will happen.\n\nOne legal expert said he had never heard of “affluenza” and doesn’t think it would be a good reason for reducing punishment. Another psychologist, Dr. Suniya Luthar, says that research shows wealthy teenagers are more likely to believe they can get out of trouble because of their parents’ wealth.\n\nLuthar also says the sentence is unfair and sends a message that wealthy families can drink and drive without consequences. She notes that an African-American teenager from a poor neighborhood would not have received such a light sentence for the same crime."

Most included names, but this girl was only identified as a \"spinner\" at the Rhodes Manufacturing Co.\n\nAuthor and historian Joe Manning spent five years trying to find her name. He searched the 1910 Lincolnton census and made a list of white girls born about 1898 with an older sister. He found 12 names, including Lala Blanton.\n\nManning published the names under the mystery photos on his webpage. Two months later, he got an email from Myra \"Carol\" Cook of Louisville, Ky., who thought Lalar Blanton might be her late grandmother.\n\nCook sent Manning pictures of Blanton as an adult and a face-recognition expert confirmed the match. Manning and Cook believe the little girl in the photo is Lalar Blanton.\n\nManning said he's giving descendants their history and the children in the photos back their dignity. For 105 years, the unidentified girl has been seen as just a child laborer. Now she becomes a human being.\n\nManning became interested in Hine nine years ago through author Elizabeth Winthrop. A Hine photo inspired a fictional character for her children's book \"Counting on Grace.\"\n\nWinthrop asked Manning to find out what happened to the real girl. He tracked down descendants and found her granddaughter in 11 days.\n\nSince then, Manning has been hunting descendants of subjects in Hine photos.

She archives music for international exchanges over networks and knows how important it is to have instantaneous feedback when playing music.\n\nA team led by computer research scientist Brighten Godfrey from the University of Illinois and Duke University is working on a project called \"Networking at the Speed of Light.\" They want to create an Internet that can reach the universe's physical limit, which would allow for instant messaging chats without delays and musicians in different parts of the world to play music together seamlessly.\n\nThe problem with the current internet is latency, which is the time delay for a signal to travel through a network. Data packets travel about 10 times slower than the speed of light, which can cause frustration for musicians who want to play music together online.\n\nEven at light speed, there would still be a delay of 133 milliseconds between two musicians standing at opposite points on the planet. This is why real-time collaboration remains a challenge.\n\nTechnology has already changed music creation, with lessons and auditions being held via YouTube and composer Eric Whitacre's \"Virtual Choir\" mixing voices from around the world onto one track.\n\nBut high-frequency trading has shown that data can move at lightning speed. In the mid-1980s, the round-trip delay between the New York and Chicago stock exchanges was 14.5 milliseconds, which was cut down to 8.5 milliseconds using microwave links.\n\nA recent performance at Stanford showed the promise of using internet speed to build cultural bridges through music.

The system, developed by a company called STRIVR, uses real people and environments to create realistic scenarios that players can practice in.\n\nThe system was first used by Stanford University's football team, where it helped quarterback Kevin Hogan improve his performance. The team's coach, David Shaw, is a big fan of the technology and believes it will soon be part of every top program's regimen.\n\nThe system works by using virtual reality headsets to transport players into game-like scenarios. They can practice reading defenses, making decisions, and reacting to different situations. The system also allows coaches to see exactly what their players are seeing, which helps them identify areas for improvement.\n\nOne of the key benefits of the system is that it allows players to practice in a safe environment.

Other countries, such as South Africa, Namibia, and Tanzania, do allow it because they think it helps local communities and conservation efforts. But critics argue that the rules aren't always followed properly.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, a professional hunter was charged with helping an American dentist, Walter James Palmer, kill a well-known lion named Cecil. Conservationists say the hunters used a dead animal to lure Cecil out of a national park and then shot him after 40 hours of tracking.\n\nPalmer has faced intense criticism on social media and has closed his dental practice temporarily.\n\n\"Cecil is not the first lion that has been lured,\" said Ian Michler, a conservationist from South Africa. \"Unethical hunting happens all the time across the continent.\"\n\nMichler made a documentary about lions being bred in captivity for trophy hunting.

But some conservationists disagree with this claim.\n\nHunting is a significant source of income for South Africa, valued at about $490 million annually. However, some argue that this figure might be exaggerated to justify the economic benefits of hunting.\n\nLions are considered vulnerable globally, with estimates suggesting fewer than 20,000 exist in the wild – a decline of around 40% over two decades.

This makes fishermen want to catch the bigger fish first. Once there are not enough big fish left, they start catching smaller ones. This pattern has been called \"fishing down the food web.\"\n\nA team of scientists studied how much predatory fish have declined since industrial fishing started. They looked at over 200 studies that included more than 3,000 ocean species. The results show that humans reduced the amount of predatory fish by two-thirds in the 20th century. Most of this decline has happened since the 1970s.\n\nMany of these big fish are known to be in trouble. Some species of grouper, tuna and sharks are threatened with extinction. When predators disappear, it can affect entire ocean ecosystems. For example, sea urchins have destroyed kelp forests because they don't have any natural enemies anymore.\n\nIn the US, science-based fisheries management has helped improve the situation. Thirty-four fish stocks have been rebuilt since 2000 and most US fish stocks are not overfished. However, globally, almost 30 percent of fish stocks are still overfished. The main problem is in developing countries where there needs to be more effective institutions for managing fisheries.\n\nThe new study provides important information on how many fish we should take from the oceans. It shows that we have been taking too much of some species and need to reduce fishing quotas. This will help ensure healthy populations of these fish and healthy oceans in the future."

They believe it is the earliest settlement of free African-Americans in the United States.\n\nThe site dates back to 1790. But another community, Treme in New Orleans, is recognized as the oldest free black community. It was established in 1812. Researchers say that could change based on findings from the Easton dig.\n\n\"It's not just a black story. It's an American story,\" said Dale Green, a Morgan State University professor of architecture and historic preservation.\n\nFormer slaves founded such settlements. They enjoyed early emancipation and the chance at property ownership and commerce. Slaves who had bought their freedom likely formed The Hill. Historians say it could have been the largest community of free blacks in the Chesapeake region.\n\nDuring the first census in 1790, some 410 free African-Americans were recorded living on The Hill. This was more than Baltimore's 250 free African-Americans and even more than the 346 slaves who lived at nearby Wye House Plantation.\n\nResearchers are working in 5-by-5-foot squares to uncover artifacts. They have found evidence of making nails and raising chickens on the land — activities far more likely to have been carried out by free blacks who lived on the land.\n\nFree African-Americans in Easton lived alongside white families, according to Green.\n\nThe team has committed to spending at least five more years working at The Hill. Since the dig began at the Price property, more than 500 people have visited on organized tours or have wandered in after seeing \"public archaeology excavation\" signs posted around the block.\n\nPriscilla Morris is a regular visitor to the site. She's intrigued by the role Quakers and Methodists played in freeing their own slaves and advocating for an end to slavery well before the Civil War.\n\n\"It's thrilling because we suspected there was something here we didn't understand,\" Morris said. Most written histories skip over the experiences of free African-Americans, said Morris.\n\nGreen said the work on The Hill could change the way American history is told. There's a significant gap where the story of free blacks is overlooked, he said.\n\nThere are ambitious plans to get the word out about The Hill, including dissertations from graduate students working on the project, permanent and traveling museum exhibits, updated tourism initiatives and even a screenplay.\n\nThe Hill already is part of the National Register of Historic Places that includes Easton's historic district. But that listing will be revised to include information about the African-American history.\n\nAbout 75 researchers and students are contributing to The Hill project.

Edina, a city in Minnesota, started a fourth-grade travel team two years ago and now has three teams for this age group.\n\nThe teams play around 40 games per winter and the fee to join is $500. Parents are driving the demand for these elite teams, with some even hiring personal coaches for their kids. The pressure can be intense, with parents tracking every shot taken by their child's team.\n\nSome parents see the end goal as a college athletic scholarship, but others just want their kids to stay out of trouble and have fun. The cost of participating in travel basketball can add up quickly, with expenses including uniforms, shoes, and equipment bags.\n\nDespite the challenges, many parents feel that it is worth it for their children to be part of a competitive team. However, there are also concerns about the level of competition and the behavior of some parents at games. Edina officials have had to deal with unruly parents in the past, but they believe that the benefits of travel basketball outweigh the drawbacks.\n\nAs the popularity of youth travel basketball continues to grow, it is likely that even younger age groups will start competing at this level. While some may see this as a positive trend, others worry about the impact on young children's lives and the pressure they face to perform."

They want to create a new system that makes more sense.\n\nSome languages like Finnish, Spanish, and Italian have spellings that match how they sound when you say them out loud. English doesn't work this way. Words with the same letters can be said differently, and some sounds can be spelled different ways depending on the word.\n\nThe experts think that if words were spelled in a more logical way, kids would learn to read faster. They point to studies that show English-speaking children take longer to learn basic reading skills than kids from other European countries. \n\nThe group wants to create a list of new spellings for tricky word groups like \"ough\". They're not just trying to make the language easier, but also to help people who are learning to read.\n\nThere have been similar movements in America before. A long time ago, some newspapers used simpler spellings, and President Theodore Roosevelt even tried to get Congress to change the way words were spelled. But those changes didn't stick.\n\nThe experts think that if they can get society on board with their ideas, it will be easier to make changes happen. They're not trying to force people to adopt a new spelling system, but rather to let people decide what works best for them."

Now, he wants to teach these skills to his own daughter.\n\nBoothe plays games with his daughter that involve shapes and word association. For example, they count down the time on the microwave timer together. Boothe also teaches his daughter about numbers and says greatness is their goal.\n\nA study from Scotland found that children who are good at reading and math when they're seven years old will make more money when they grow up. This is true even if they don't have a high IQ or come from a wealthy family.\n\nTimothy Bates, a professor at the University of Edinburgh, says that learning to read and do math early in life can lead to better jobs and higher pay later on. He found that children who were good readers when they were seven years old made $8,000 more per year by the time they were 45.\n\nHowever, some educators in the US disagree with these findings. They say that income also plays a big role in how well children do in school. Only about half of American children attend high-quality pre-kindergarten programs, where they learn important skills like reading and math.\n\nLibby Doggett from the US Department of Education says that it's not just about ability, but also about creating opportunities for children to learn. She believes that early learning is critical for career success.\n\nGreg Duncan, a professor at the University of California-Irvine, says that there is a big gap in reading and math skills between rich and poor children when they start kindergarten. He attributes this gap to differences in parenting practices and access to quality education.\n\nSilvia Tarafa, a principal in Florida, suggests ways for parents to introduce reading and math lessons into their daily activities. For example, they can read nonfiction books together, bake cakes using measuring cups, and compare prices at the store.\n\nTarafa also says that parents should use everyday activities to teach important concepts like fractions, subtraction, and measurement. By doing so, children will be better prepared when these concepts are introduced in school.\n\nOverall, the key is to make learning fun and engaging for young children. By introducing reading and math skills early on, parents can set their kids up for success in the future."

She is trying to figure out why holes keep appearing and disappearing in the sand. The holes are about a foot wide and seem to fill up with sand after a day.\n\nArgyilan said, \"We're seeing what appears to be a new geological phenomenon.\" Many experts have been searching for clues on how these holes form, but no one is sure yet. They have used special tools like ground-penetrating radar and GPS devices to look beneath the surface, but they still don't know why the holes appear.\n\nMount Baldy has been closed because of two new holes and some depressions found on the north side slope. Argyilan wants to help explain what's happening because she was doing research near Mount Baldy when a 6-year-old boy fell into one of the holes in July. The boy was buried under 11 feet of sand for three hours before being rescued.\n\nOne theory is that decaying trees under the sand might be causing the holes. Human activity on the dunes has led to erosion, which could have buried trees and caused them to rot. Argyilan thinks this might be why the holes are forming.\n\nThe National Park Service is planting new grass in the area where native grass used to grow. They hope this will help hold the sand in place and prevent more holes from forming. The park service is also planning a more thorough investigation of the dune this summer.\n\nMount Baldy will remain closed until it's safe for visitors again. Rangers will be enforcing the closure, which might last through the summer and into the fall.

Deep poverty means earning less than half of what the federal government says is necessary to meet basic needs.\n\nMaryland is one example. Overall, Maryland has a low rate of poverty compared to other states. But it also has a high percentage of people living in deep poverty.\n\nThere are several reasons for this. Some areas in Maryland have high concentrations of poor people who lack access to economic opportunities and safety-net programs. For instance, Baltimore has neighborhoods where more than 90% of residents live below the poverty line, and many are homeless or unemployed.\n\nTraditional anti-poverty programs may not be effective in addressing these issues. In response, some organizations like Catholic Charities have started providing job training, housing help, and other services to people in need.\n\nOther states with low overall poverty rates also struggle with deep poverty. Hawaii has a high cost of living that exacerbates the problem, while Massachusetts has areas with concentrated economic despair.\n\nNationally, about 34% of low-income residents live in deep poverty. Half of those are younger than 25 years old, and more than a third are younger than 17. Programs like free or reduced-price lunches in schools and health care programs can help poor children.\n\nReaching childless adults in deep poverty is harder because many safety-net programs require work or limit benefits to parents. Many deeply poor people face barriers that make it difficult for them to find work, such as domestic violence or mental health issues.\n\nSome experts argue that any solution must emphasize work and self-sufficiency, while others say that addressing underlying barriers like housing and healthcare is crucial."

The country wants to buy or rent farms in other countries where land is cheaper and more productive than it is in China.\n\nChinese companies are buying up farmland all over the world, from the United States to Australia and Brazil. This has raised concerns about food security and whether China's growing demand for agricultural products can be met without harming local farmers and communities.\n\nOne reason China wants to invest in foreign farms is that its own land is not very productive. The country has only 9% of the world's arable land, but it has 22% of the world's population. This means that Chinese farmers have to work very hard to produce enough food for everyone.\n\nAnother problem is that many of China's farmers are getting older and do not have the skills or technology to farm efficiently. The government wants to encourage younger people to become farmers, but this is a challenge because many young people prefer to move to cities for better job opportunities.\n\nChinese companies are also investing in foreign farms to produce food specifically for export back to China. This can be controversial because it raises concerns about the impact on local food supplies and whether Chinese companies are exploiting local resources.\n\nSome countries have placed restrictions on foreign ownership of farmland, but this has not stopped Chinese companies from finding ways to invest in agriculture abroad. They are using creative financing models and partnering with local businesses to get around these restrictions.\n\nOverall, China's push into global agriculture is driven by its need for food security and its desire to become a major player in the world agricultural market.

The authors say this undermines the government's position that more cases have been discovered in the area only because of stringent monitoring.\n\nMost of the 370,000 children in Fukushima prefecture (state) have been given ultrasound checkups since the March 2011 meltdowns at the tsunami-ravaged Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant. The most recent statistics show that thyroid cancer is suspected or confirmed in 137 of those children, a number that rose by 25 from a year earlier.\n\n\"This is more than expected and emerging faster than expected,\" lead author Toshihide Tsuda said. \"This is 20 times to 50 times what would be normally expected.\"\n\nThe study was released online this week and will be published in the November issue of Epidemiology. The data comes from tests overseen by Fukushima Medical University.\n\nSome scientists question whether radiation can cause cancer, but thyroid cancer among children has been linked to radiation after the 1986 Chernobyl catastrophe. If treated, it is rarely fatal, and early detection is a plus.\n\nScientists are divided on Tsuda's conclusions. Some say that individual-level data to estimate actual radiation doses is needed, while others agree with Tsuda's findings.\n\nConclusions about any connection between Fukushima radiation and cancer will help determine compensation and other policies. Many people who live in areas deemed safe by the government have fled fearing sickness, especially for their children.\n\nAn area extending about 20 kilometers from the nuclear plant has been declared an exclusion zone. The borders are constantly being remapped as cleanup of radiated debris and soil continues in an effort to bring as many people back as possible. Decommissioning the plant is expected to take decades.\n\nNoriko Matsumoto, a mother who fled to Tokyo with her daughter after the disaster, said \"My daughter has the right to live free of radiation.\" She believes that radiation may be behind sicknesses, but cannot be sure.\n\nResearch on what follows a catastrophe is complex and difficult. The study's limitations include assessment of individual radiation dose levels to the thyroid and the ability to fully assess the impact of screening on the excess cases detected.\n\n\"Nonetheless, this study is critical to initiate additional investigations of possible health effects, for governmental planning, and increasing public awareness.\""

But another species, the big brown bat, is doing well and its numbers are rising.\n\nExperts say the number of little brown bats has dropped by about 90 percent since white nose first hit in 2009. In fact, there are so few left that the species might not be able to recover at all. \n\nBut big brown bats have actually thrived since white nose struck. Their numbers are increasing so much that they have begun to take over summer roosting spots formerly occupied by little brown bats.\n\nSome researchers have found hopeful signs for little brown bats. Some banded little brown bats have returned to hibernate each year in the same caves and abandoned mine shafts, showing that at least this small group has managed to fight off the disease.\n\nFederal officials estimate that 7 million bats among seven species have died nationally since white nose was first detected in a cave near Albany, New York. The disease has now spread to 25 states.\n\nBats become infected while in hibernation with a fungus that leaves a whitish powder on their muzzles, ears and wing membranes. The fungus causes the bats to move around during hibernation, which burns up vital stored body fat. As a result, they die of hunger.\n\nThe loss of bats can affect humans, since bats eat vast quantities of insects that damage crops or carry West Nile virus and other diseases.\n\nBanding efforts in New Jersey have led researchers to conclude that while the overall numbers are still declining, the survival rate for hibernating little brown bats in New Jersey has been increasing slightly each year. \n\nSeveral groups of researchers across the country are closing in on promising treatments. Some researchers are looking at whether a certain bacteria that has antifungal properties could help the bats fight off infection.\n\nEven if they were to rebound, it could take centuries for bats to reach their pre-white nose numbers.\n\nThe response to white nose has varied by bat species. The tricolored bat and the northern long-eared bat have also suffered catastrophic declines. But the Virginia big-eared bat has survived unscathed in caves where bats of other species have been found dying all around them.\n\nBig brown bats increased 14 percent at summer roost sites in New Jersey this year, and are now up as much as 50 percent since white nose appeared. One key reason is that big brown bats are larger, and therefore lose less heat to the environment during hibernation, making it easier to sustain themselves on their stored body fat.\n\nThey also hibernate a month later and emerge a month earlier than little brown bats, reducing the impact of the disease. In addition, they hibernate in very small groups or alone, whereas little brown bats and Indiana bats — another affected species — hibernate close together in large groups, making it easier for the disease to spread.\n\nFinally, unlike many bat species, big brown bats produce two pups a year, making it easier for them to increase their overall numbers."

It also changed art, music, literature, and film.\n\nBefore the war, many people thought that science and technology would make the world a better place. But the war showed that these things could be used to hurt people. This made artists create works that were very different from what they had done before. They created paintings, music, and writings that showed how terrible the war was.\n\nSome writers wrote about how bad it was to die for your country. One writer said that words like \"glory\" and \"honor\" didn't mean anything when compared to the names of villages and rivers where people died.\n\nMany soldiers came back from the war hurt, both physically and emotionally. They were called a \"lost generation.\" Some writers wrote about how these soldiers felt, like they didn't fit in anymore.\n\nThe war also changed how people thought about things like hierarchy and honor. A movie made in 1937 showed how the war destroyed old ideas of what it meant to be a soldier.\n\nWorld War I was a turning point in history. It made artists question everything, including how to tell stories and make art. Some writers stopped using traditional ways of writing, while others created new kinds of music and art that were very different from what had come before.\n\nThe war also inspired people to create works of modernism. These works showed how the world was changing and how people saw each other differently after the war.\n\nOne of the most famous posters from the war was one that said \"I Want YOU For U.S. Army.\" This poster, created by James Montgomery Flagg, has become an iconic image of the war."

They did this because the French government had decided not to let her family stay in the country.\n\nMany people think that the real reason she was taken away was because of her ethnicity. She is Romani, which is also known as Gypsy. Experts say that it's very common for Roma people to be treated unfairly.\n\nA report by a charity group called Oxfam said that the Roma are \"the most vulnerable and deprived ethnic group within Europe.\" It also said that they are more likely to be poor and discriminated against in many areas, including employment, education, healthcare, and other services.\n\nThe story of Leonarda Dibrani's expulsion from France was surprising. Hundreds of French students and supporters protested in the streets of Paris, demanding that she be allowed to return. This made some people think that things might start to change for the Roma.\n\nBut then something else happened. A Greek Roma family was accused of kidnapping a blonde girl who police found when they searched their settlement. This brought up old stereotypes about the Roma being involved in child trafficking.\n\nThese stereotypes have been around for centuries. Even famous authors like Cervantes wrote stories about the Roma stealing children.\n\nA human rights attorney named Claudia Tavani said that these stereotypes are not true. She also said that the recent economic crisis in Europe has made things worse for the Roma, especially in countries like Greece and Italy.\n\nTavani said that people should try to understand the Roma better instead of blaming them for everything. She also said that the Roma can be part of the solution to some of Europe's problems, such as an aging population and a lack of workers.\n\nCordula Simon, a commissioner in Berlin, is working to help Roma immigrants. She believes that if we help them when they arrive, get their children into school, and find them shelter and jobs, things will get better.\n\nSimon also said that there are positive stories about the Roma that people should hear. For example, young Roma children who come from poor areas in Romania and Bulgaria are very eager to learn when they start school in Berlin.\n\nMitek is a 37-year-old Roma immigrant from Bulgaria who came to Berlin hoping for a better life. He lost his job at home and couldn't find any prospects, so he left his wife and children behind. He's been living in an abandoned factory and scavenging for plastic bottles to make ends meet.\n\nDespite his difficult circumstances, Mitek still has hope that things will get better. He wants to find a job and bring his family to live with him in Berlin."

Instead, they're using their phones and tablets to watch videos on YouTube and Netflix. This shift in viewing habits is especially evident among tweens and teens.\n\nA recent study found that 88% of American teens have a mobile phone, and 73% have smartphones. Even younger kids are getting their own devices, with some as young as 8 having their own phones.\n\nKids love YouTube because it's interactive and they can easily find content they want to watch. They use it for everything from watching product reviews to doing homework help. Netflix is also popular among kids due to its family-friendly content.\n\nUnlike adults who may cut ties with cable companies to save money, kids' digital viewing behaviors are more instinctive than intentional. They prefer screens on phones and tablets that they can control and manipulate easily.\n\nAs a result, TV viewing on actual TV sets is declining. Many kids don't want to watch anything on the big screen, even if it's available through devices like Chromecast.\n\nThis shift in viewing habits has far-reaching consequences for the future of television. Kids are used to having content at their fingertips and can easily switch between different devices and platforms.\n\n**Key Statistics:**\n\n* 88% of American teens have a mobile phone\n* 73% of teens have smartphones\n* 68% of kids watch TV on actual TV sets (down from 73% in 2014)\n* Kids as young as 1 are starting to use YouTube and other digital platforms"

They want to make organs for transplants in the lab.\n\nThis isn't the only lab doing this type of research. But on Tuesday, Mayor Boris Johnson announced plans to attract more labs to do cutting-edge health and science research in the area. \n\nOnly a few patients have received organs made by British scientists so far. These include tear ducts, blood vessels, and windpipes. Researchers hope they will soon be able to transplant other body parts into patients.\n\nThe scientist leading this effort is Alexander Seifalian at University College London. He says making organs is like baking a cake. \"We just use a different kind of oven,\" he said.\n\nBritish authorities have invested nearly $6.7 million in the research plan. The goal is to attract companies and promote collaboration between researchers and manufacturers. A major center for biological research will open in London next year.\n\nSeifalian showed off a machine that makes molds from polymer material for organs. Last year, he made a nose for a British man who lost his to cancer. The team added a salt and sugar solution to mimic the texture of a natural nose. Then they used stem cells from the patient's fat to cover the nose scaffold.\n\nThe nose was implanted into the man's forearm so that skin would grow to cover it. Seifalian is waiting for approval to transfer the nose onto the patient's face.\n\nSeifalian has patented his organ scaffolds and applied for patents for blood vessels, tear ducts, and windpipes. He's also creating other organs like coronary arteries and ears.\n\nA trial will start later this year in India and London to test lab-made ears for people born without them. Dr. Michelle Griffin says making ears is harder than noses because you have to get all the contours right.\n\nGriffin hopes to eventually create an entirely synthetic face but must first prove that their polymer scaffolds are safe. Eileen Gentleman, a stem cell expert, says scientists need to get things like noses and ears right before moving onto more complicated organs like kidneys or livers.\n\nSome scientists think lab-made organs will be available on the market soon. Seifalian hopes they'll be affordable for everyone. He thinks that one day, different sizes of noses could be mass-produced like in a factory."

The rally was one of over 155 happening around the world.\n\nThe protesters were upset about many things, including high crime rates, food shortages and lack of freedom in their country. They also called on other countries to help them get rid of President Nicolas Maduro's government.\n\nMaria Archer has lived in the United States for 15 years. She said she was at the rally because \"we are tired of a government that represses people, doesn't allow free speech and is responsible for food shortages and violence.\" \n\nAnother protester, Blanca Aleman, 44, said \"I love my country but I want my kids to know the Venezuela I knew, not what it is now.\"\n\nAleman's parents and brother are still in Venezuela. Her son Marc Burnard was able to accompany her to the rally.\n\nThe rally was organized by several groups including Un Mundo Sin Mordaza (A World Without Censorship). Carlos Tagliafica said the rallies were held to support students who have been leading protests in Venezuela.\n\nIn Venezuela, protests over the past two weeks have resulted in violence and deaths as government opponents and supporters fight. At least 10 people have died since February 12.\n\nThe ongoing protests are some of the biggest seen since President Hugo Chavez died last year. Prominent opposition figure Leopoldo Lopez has been jailed on charges of fomenting violence, which has caused outrage among his supporters and criticism by human rights groups.\n\nIn Doral, rally participants joined together in chants, songs and even prayer following a moment of silence. Veronica Arocha said \"it's horrible\" what is happening in Venezuela. She keeps in touch with her family using the mobile messaging application WhatsApp. She says there are many shortages including food and medicine.\n\nAlthough most supporters at the rally were Venezuelan, other Latin American communities joined the movement. Cuban-born Berardo Barrero said he took part because he can relate to the situation in Venezuela.\n\nRamon Saul Sanchez was also at the Doral rally. He has organized several \"freedom flotillas\" to waters near Cuba. Sanchez said he was there to lend solidarity to the Venezuelan people and to tell them that Cubans are not responsible for what is happening in Venezuela.\n\nCuban military advisers are widely believed to be deployed in Venezuela to provide training or advice in intelligence, weapons and military logistics.\n\nLatin Americans from Argentina, Peru, Nicaragua and elsewhere were also present at the rally. Venezuelan Andrea Taglia Ferro said \"it's great\" that other Latin American countries are showing support. She added that social media has helped raise awareness about what is happening in Venezuela.\n\nMost protesters agreed that the only way to improve things is for there to be a change in leadership. Enrique Chacon said \"the country is sinking.\" He attended the rally with his brother, sister-in-law, nephew and niece."

But first, she must pass an algebra class that costs more than $400.\n\nShe doesn't think she'll use algebra as a cop. \"I gotta catch the criminal,\" she said. \"I'm not going to be finding X.\"\n\nMany American college students are like Kelsey. They are enrolled in remedial classes, which cost over $3 billion each year. But these classes rarely lead to graduation.\n\nMath is often the subject that holds students back. Some researchers and teachers think math should be taught differently in community colleges. They say algebra-heavy requirements are not relevant to many students' career plans.\n\nThis can leave many students trapped. They have to spend money on classes that don't count toward their degrees. This increases the odds that they will drop out.\n\n\"(Remedial) mathematics is the graveyard,\" said Anthony Bryk of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. \"This is where aspirations go to die.\"\n\nSome Illinois community colleges are trying a new approach. It's called \"math literacy.\" Students tackle practical problems instead of theoretical ones.\n\n\"We're not saying, 'Let's reduce standards.' We're saying, 'Let's change the way we teach (them),' \" said Kathy Almy, a professor at Rockford's Rock Valley College.\n\nIllinois students must take only three years of high school math. Many skip the subject their senior year. This can cause problems when they take college placement tests.\n\nExperts say the expense and frustration often lead students to abandon school. Only 14 percent of Illinois community college students who take remedial classes graduate in three years.\n\nChicago-area colleges are coming up with new ways to help students navigate algebra. But the math itself is usually the same as it has always been.\n\nThe math literacy movement aims to address this issue. The idea is based on research by the Carnegie Foundation and the American Mathematical Association of Two Year Colleges.\n\nTraditional math classes begin with theory and proceed to problems. But Almy designed a one-semester course that works in reverse. Teachers give students real-world questions, and then show them how to use math to find the answers.\n\nAlmy said students who struggle with math respond well to practicality. She gave an example of a problem her class took up: You go to a restaurant's 25-cent wing night with a $20 bill. After buying a $5 pitcher of beer, how many wings can you get?\n\nThe class had no trouble with that answer, but the problem grew steadily more difficult as Almy added factors like side dishes, tax and tip.\n\nVerenice Sandoval, 18, a business major, said she appreciated the class's method. \"What's different about this course is that it applies more to real life,\" she said.\n\nAlmy said the course allows students to complete their remedial math requirement in one semester. Its overall passing rate of roughly 65 percent is about the same as other remedial math classes at the college.\n\nThe City Colleges of Chicago are trying out math literacy classes at two campuses. But most area community colleges have yet to use this approach.\n\nSome professors doubt it will be a cure-all, noting that many students come in with weaknesses in basic arithmetic and even reading. And the class won't be enough for those with majors in science or technology.\n\nBut math literacy appears bound to catch on. \"Eventually we'll have most if not all colleges doing this,\" said Brian Durham of the Illinois Community College Board.\n\nAlmy hopes that traditional math education will become more realistic. She says it currently treats all students like they want to become doctors, when not everyone does."

They are using a technique called polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that copies DNA so it can be identified. The process takes about three minutes and could eventually take less than 10 minutes.\n\nThe goal of the project is to have Fast PCR devices in every doctor's office, allowing patients to submit a sample and get results while they are still at their appointment. This would allow doctors to quickly decide on the best course of treatment.\n\nThe team has been working on speeding up the amplification part of the process since 2010. They are now able to do it in less than three minutes by rapidly cooling and heating the sample. The next step is to integrate optics into the device to detect the DNA even earlier, which could make the whole process take less than 10 minutes.\n\nThe technology could also be used in other areas where time is important, such as detecting harmful bacteria in food or monitoring for diseases during outbreaks.

They use it to push for more rights for women in sports and other areas. The first women's basketball team was created 11 years ago by Lina Almaeena. She said, \"We are an activist team... We took it upon ourselves to promote the sport when it was a taboo.\"\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, women have to follow strict rules about what they wear. They cannot be seen by men while jogging in sweatpants or wearing shorts. Most women cover their hair and face with a veil.\n\nEven though there are many restrictions, women's basketball is growing.

It made me more active in society, school, and studies. It made me more social and confident.\"\n\nAt a recent basketball practice in Jiddah, girls as young as 4 years old played on open-air courts. Boys played on nearby courts.\n\nLina Almaeena said that basketball is popular among Saudi girls because it offers teamwork and can be played indoors and outdoors. The sport has grown into a network of teams in different cities.\n\nDespite the growth, women's basketball still faces many obstacles due to strict gender-segregation rules. Women's teams are not part of the kingdom's sports federation, and they struggle to find facilities to train. They also cannot attend matches in stadiums.\n\nThere is also strong opposition from conservative clerics who say that sports like basketball can harm women's virginity. Some argue that sports make women more masculine.\n\nAlmaeena's team faced negative publicity in 2009 after playing a tournament in Jordan. The players were not wearing their abayas, and photographs of them in modest track suits landed in local newspapers. They were labeled \"immoral\" and \"satanic.\"\n\nJiddah is the most liberal city in Saudi Arabia, and it has become the center for women's basketball. The city has a distinct culture that is more open than other parts of the country.\n\nHadeer Sadagah said, \"Jiddah is where women are most physically active in society... I think it's the society. We are different.\"\n\nWomen's sports in Jiddah still face restrictions, and joining a club like Jiddah United costs around $130 a month. Women also need to pay for a chauffeur because they are not allowed to drive.\n\nFor now, women's basketball remains a small but growing phenomenon. For enthusiastic players and parents, it is a source of exercise and confidence-building life lessons.\n\nUmar Abdul Salam, an American coach, said, \"The concept of sports brings what we're trying to teach... Leadership skills, role-playing, and how to manage your time.\"\n\nAlaa AlShuwayer, a mother of two young girls, recently checked out a basketball practice. She is considering enrolling her daughters.\n\n\"I know there's nothing wrong with girls or boys playing sports,\" she said. \"I'd rather they play sports than buy them dresses and earrings.\""

It also has complex effects on ecosystems and human health that we don't fully understand yet. Research shows that it changes the way diseases spread. The study looked at snake bites, which affect 2.5 million people worldwide each year.\n\nBecause snakes rely on their environment to regulate their body temperature, changes in weather patterns due to climate change might affect their behavior.

They found that during El Nino, the rate of snake bites increased, especially among poor, rural communities.\n\nThis increase in snake bites is surprising because snakes are usually less active in cold weather. The study suggests that snakes might be venturing out more to find food when it's scarce.\n\nThe researchers are calling for more research on how climate change affects snake bites and how it disproportionately affects poor communities.

To manage this surge, \"rocket dockets\" have been created to quickly decide whether these children should be sent back to their home countries.\n\nVolunteer lawyers are preparing for up to 50 hearings a day per judge to ensure that these children's rights are protected and they can avoid immediate deportation. This rapid process is necessary due to the large influx of children fleeing violence and poverty in Central America, with over 3,000 arriving in Florida this year to join family members.\n\nImmigration judges in Miami and Orlando are focusing solely on these cases, but advocates worry that the swift proceedings may compromise fairness. Many children appear without representation, which can lead to those with legitimate claims being sent back to dangerous situations.\n\nLegal aid groups are working to provide attorneys for these children, citing concerns about their ability to navigate the complex legal system alone. Federal officials report that 3,181 of these children have come to Florida this year, with dozens more expected to arrive soon.\n\nUnder a 2008 law, unaccompanied minors cannot be removed from the country without a chance to claim they should remain due to danger in their homeland. While some have become permanent residents and others have been deported, the numbers have increased dramatically due to escalating violence and gang activity in countries like Honduras.\n\nFlorida has previously handled large influxes of immigrants but rarely has resorted to expedited proceedings.

However, in recent years, the city has begun to acknowledge and commemorate its past.\n\n**Survivors Share Their Stories**\n\nChen Guifang, 80, lost her parents during a bombing raid when she was just 10 years old. She had to live on the streets, collecting coal to sell and eventually finding work in a textile factory. Wang, another orphan, became homeless at age 9 and survived by scavenging for food and selling his services as a fan boy in restaurants.\n\nLu Xianbo's father died during a bombing raid because he returned home during a lull in the airstrikes. Lu's family was devastated, but he is determined to keep fighting for justice.\n\n**Chongqing's Sacrifices**\n\nThe Japanese government had hoped that by bombing Chongqing, they could break the city's spirit and prompt a surrender. However, the opposite happened. The bombings strengthened the Chinese people's resolve to defend their country.\n\nNewsreels of the bombings helped shape international opinion about Japan's brutal expansionism, but after the war ended, Chongqing slipped off the radar. Mao Zedong's Communist Party took power, and the city's history was largely forgotten.\n\n**Remembering the Past**\n\nToday, Chongqing is more open about its past, with museums and memorials dedicated to the war effort. The city has also sought to highlight its collaboration with the United States during the war.\n\nHowever, feelings towards Japan are more complicated. While many residents bear no ill will towards the Japanese people, they feel that Tokyo has yet to acknowledge and apologize for its past atrocities.\n\n**Seeking Justice**\n\nOver 180 Chongqing bombing survivors have attempted to sue Japan in Japanese courts, seeking compensation and an apology.

Nearly one-third of consumers said they looked online overall for Halloween costumes.\n\n\"I post stuff after I pick out my outfit,\" especially on Facebook and Instagram, said Jessica Medina, 33, as she shopped at a Spirit Halloween store. \"I also search online to see what's out there and my friends post things.\"\n\nThe impact of social media \"has been exponential,\" said Jeff Green, a Phoenix-based retail consultant.\n\n\"It's more of a social holiday now, with 'social' meaning that people not only are enjoying Halloween with one another but sending it out to the world,\" he added.\n\nConsumer spending on Halloween still pales next to the winter holiday season, which includes Thanksgiving and Christmas and generates about $616 billion in sales. Halloween spending also trails back-to-school shopping, which totals around $74 billion annually.\n\nOther items that are popular during Halloween include candy, pumpkins and decorations.\n\nNine out of 10 Americans are forecast to buy candy this year, spending $2.1 billion, slightly less than the $2.2 billion spent last year.\n\nAbout 41 percent of Americans also will carve a fresh pumpkin.\n\nCalifornia produces the most pumpkins for the fresh market (192 million pounds last year) of any state, and nearly three-quarters of California's pumpkins are grown in the San Joaquin Valley.\n\nAnother trend is the continued growth of temporary, or \"pop-up,\" Halloween stores that lease space in vacant stores or other buildings for the six weeks leading to Halloween.\n\nSpirit Halloween claims to be the largest operator of such stores. Another big player is Party City, which sells Halloween items in its conventional stores and in 300 temporary Halloween City stores.\n\nThen there are the haunted theme-park attractions, such as Knott's \"Scary Farm\" and \"Fright Fest\" at Six Flags Entertainment Corp.'s Magic Mountain, both in the Los Angeles area."

This is the first time it has been spotted on the U.S. mainland. \n\nThe worm can multiply anywhere, anytime because it is hermaphroditic. It eats snails and other soft creatures living in soil. Scientists worry it could spread through garden soil or plants.\n\nWhile humans are at little risk from the worm, it thrives on snails. To eat a snail, the worm latches onto the shell's opening and spits its stomach out to dissolve the snail's flesh. \n\nThe worm is native to New Guinea and has now been documented in 22 countries. Its arrival on the U.S. mainland is alarming because it could spread quickly.\n\nIn his study, Jean-Lou Justine said the worm was first reported in the U.S. on Southwest 122nd Street in Miami in June 2012. Four months later, another sighting was reported on Northwest Fifth Avenue. \n\nThe worm carries a parasite that can infect humans and cause muscle aches and sensitivity to light. It is also coated in toxic slime that can cause allergic reactions.\n\nScientists are concerned about the impact of the worm on South Florida's native snail population, which is already threatened by habitat loss, climate change, collectors, and invasive fire ants.\n\n\"They are nowhere else to be found,\" said Makiri Sei, a malacologist. \"So once they are gone from South Florida, they are gone from the whole world.\"\n\nThe worm has devastated snail populations in Guam and on the Mariana Islands.

Rocks weighing up to 600 pounds move across the dry lake bed, leaving behind trails that seem impossible. The rocks move without any visible force or tracks, and scientists have been trying to figure out how this happens for decades.\n\nRecently, two cousins, Richard and James Norris, witnessed the rocks moving and took photos as evidence. They found that the rocks are moved by ice floes that form on the lake bed during rare winter storms. The ice floes break apart when the sun comes out, and a light wind blows them across the shallow water, pushing the rocks along.\n\nThe Norris cousins had been studying this phenomenon since 2011 as part of their \"Slithering Stones Research Initiative.\" They installed weather stations and GPS devices on stones to track movement. On December 21, they witnessed the whole process unfold before their eyes when a light wind kicked up and the ice started cracking.\n\nTheir findings were published in the online scientific journal PLOS ONE. The study's authors included Ralph Lorenz, a researcher at Johns Hopkins University who had been studying the phenomenon for over a decade.\n\nThe movement of the rocks is incredibly slow, about 15 feet per minute.

These animals seem to be vanishing from ponds, streams, wetlands and other protected habitat in national parks and wildlife refuges.\n\nIf the trend continues, some rare amphibians could disappear in as few as six years from half of their current sites. More common species could see similar declines in 26 years.\n\nResearchers have known that some frog, toad and salamander species were in trouble. But until now they hadn't developed a broad national picture of how fast they were disappearing.\n\nAmphibians help control mosquitoes and other insect pests. They're also important for showing changes in the environment because they spend part of their lives in water and on land. They are sensitive to changes in water quality.\n\nThe study looked at results from 48 species across nearly three dozen sites around the country over nine years. It charted a \"consistently negative\" trend in how often they were found where they normally live. On average, the number of locations where amphibians could be found shrank by 3.7 percent per year.\n\nThe study did not identify the cause or causes for the declines. Amphibian losses have been linked to development, disease, chemical contaminants, climate change and introduced species.\n\nIn Maryland, state biologists say they haven't seen drastic declines in the past 20 years or so in most of the state's amphibians. But some salamanders more sensitive to disturbances in landscape or water quality have declined.\n\nUrban development likely contributes to amphibian declines.

For 37 years, this policy has caused big problems for China's population and economy.\n\nThe new two-child policy is likely to have just as much of an impact as the old one – but in a good way. One reason is that families with more children will save less money overall. This is important because China's savings rate is very high, which can cause problems for its economy and even affect other countries.\n\nChina's population has changed a lot since 1970. Back then, over half of the population was under 20 years old, but by 2010, that number had dropped to just over a quarter. At the same time, the percentage of people aged 60 or older more than doubled.\n\nAs a result, younger generations will have to support more elderly relatives, which can be tough. But when the two-child generation grows up, they'll only have to support one elderly person on average, making things easier.\n\nIn the short term, this means that families with two children will spend more money and save less. This could boost certain sectors of the economy, like education, housing, and healthcare. In fact, households with twins already spend a lot more on education than those with only one child.\n\nThere is one potential downside: with more children in each family, parents might invest less in each child's education.

Cannons are booming and men in blue and gray uniforms are running at each other.\n\nThe American Civil War was a brutal conflict that pitted brother against brother, neighbor against neighbor, and Northerner against Southerner. Hundreds of thousands were killed or injured. After the war ended, painters created round cycloramas to recreate battle scenes for curious visitors.\n\nNow, Kenosha's Civil War Museum has brought this concept into the 21st century with a 360-degree movie called \"Seeing the Elephant.\" The 11-minute film uses 11-foot-tall screens and was made with the help of 200 re-enactors over five days last summer at Old World Wisconsin.\n\nThe movie shows three men joining the Union Army for different reasons and heading off to battle. Doug Dammann, curator at the Civil War Museum in Kenosha, said they wanted to create a film that puts viewers right in the middle of the action.\n\nCycloramas were popular entertainment in the late 1800s. They were first developed in Europe before coming to America in the 1880s and often featured huge paintings of Civil War battles. Some cycloramas can still be seen today, including one in Gettysburg, Pa., and another in Atlanta with a Milwaukee connection.\n\nThe Kenosha museum's film was made with a script written by local historian Lance Herdegen, who also appeared in the film as a newspaper editor. The movie is not based on an actual battle but rather an incident that happened before the Second Battle of Bull Run.\n\nVisitors to the museum climb up to a platform and hold onto railings as they watch the action unfold around them.

This is good news because it means that vaccines and treatments being developed might still work.\n\nThe researchers looked at the genetic code of the virus from different parts of West Africa. They compared the codes to see how much the virus had changed over time. They were surprised to find that there weren't many differences, even though the samples were taken months apart.\n\nThis is important because it means that vaccines and treatments being developed will likely still work against the current strain of the virus. However, more research is needed to confirm this.\n\nAnother study found that a potential vaccine for Ebola was successful in preventing the disease in monkeys. This is promising news, but it's still unclear how well the vaccine will work in humans.\n\nExperts are also warning that even if a vaccine is developed, it's possible that the virus could mutate and become resistant to the vaccine.

Women are now more likely than men to be obese.\n\nExperts thought the obesity rate had leveled off in recent years. But new government research shows that nearly 38 percent of adults were obese in 2013-14. That's up from 32 percent about a decade earlier.\n\n\"This is a striking finding,\" said Dr. William Dietz, an expert on obesity. He added that the situation appears to be getting worse.\n\nThe report also found that women are more likely than men to be obese. The rate was significantly higher for women (38 percent) compared with men (34 percent).\n\nObesity is considered one of the nation's leading public health problems. Until the early 1980s, only about 1 in 6 adults were obese. But the rate climbed dramatically until it hit about 1 in 3 around a decade ago.\n\nThe new figures come from a regular government survey that has about 5,000 participants each year. Participants are actually weighed and measured to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI). The CDC uses BMI to measure obesity.\n\nThe news comes after years of anti-obesity campaigns. These campaigns have encouraged people to eat better and exercise. Soda consumption has dropped in recent years, and fast-food chains have adopted healthier menus.\n\nNew federal rules will remove artificial trans fats from grocery store foods. Chain restaurants also will be required to post calorie counts.\n\nThe widening gap between men and women seems to be driven by what's happening among blacks and Hispanics. Obesity rates for white men and white women remain very close. But for blacks, the female obesity rate has soared to 57 percent, far above the male rate of 38 percent.\n\nFor young people ages 2 to 19, the obesity rate has been holding at about 17 percent over the past decade or so. Health officials have focused on obesity in kids, who are the target of the Let's Move campaign launched by first lady Michelle Obama in 2010."

Lawmakers are hearing complaints about unnecessary testing.\n\nThe Common Core standards have fueled criticism, but new legislation may change the testing landscape.\n\nCongress will debate education this spring as they try to rewrite No Child Left Behind. The law, passed in 2002, mandated annual testing and severe consequences for underperforming schools.\n\nA bipartisan agreement in the Senate might reduce testing pressure by giving states more control over ensuring school quality.\n\nHowever, some parents worry that schools focus too much on test preparation, putting poor test-takers at a disadvantage. Critics argue that too much money is spent on testing, and failure can have severe consequences.\n\nEducation Secretary Arne Duncan acknowledges that there may be too much testing or test preparation, but believes annual tests are necessary to hold schools accountable for student growth.\n\nUnder No Child Left Behind, schools were required to show \"adequate yearly progress\" or face intervention. Waivers from the law's requirements came with conditions that schools base teacher evaluations partly on test scores.\n\nSome states have reduced the number of required tests, while others have passed laws limiting testing.\n\nParents who oppose testing argue that it's not a valid measure of a child's abilities and is driven by profit rather than better education. They claim that testing can lead to unfair consequences for teachers and schools.\n\nAdvocacy groups agree that while some tests are necessary, many are redundant or unnecessary.

He wanted to marry a young girl from a village near his hometown Andkhoy through an arranged marriage.

The amount can be over $20,000 which is too much for working-class Afghans.\n\nEsmatullah earns $6 a day as a laborer and his would-be in-laws want $13,000. He borrowed $8,000 from friends and relatives but cannot pay the rest. He says he does not know how long it will take to raise the money.\n\nWomen's rights advocates criticize this tradition because it puts a price tag on a daughter and makes women seem like animals. Technically walwar is illegal but local authorities tolerate it because it has been part of Afghan tribal society for hundreds of years.\n\nAfghan weddings are expensive, with guest lists numbering in the hundreds. Afghans spend tens of thousands of dollars on a wedding even though the average worker earns only $35 a month. Asadullah, a 21-year-old university student, spent $28,000 on his wedding, including $13,000 as walwar.\n\nIn 2011, a measure to limit the number of guests at weddings was rejected by President Hamid Karzai's Cabinet. Wedding hall owners say that Afghans want to outdo their friends and neighbors with bigger receptions. Even if they are not competitive, they do not want to be seen as cheapskates.\n\nLavish weddings are also a way for Afghans to escape the difficulties of everyday life in a war-torn country.

Now, they've found evidence that suggests T. rex did hunt its prey.\n\nThe discovery came in the form of a T. rex tooth lodged between the vertebrae of a hadrosaur, a plant-eating dinosaur. The vertebrae had grown around the tooth, indicating that the hadrosaur was alive when it was attacked.\n\nPaleontologists have found many fossils with T. rex tooth marks, but those could have been from scavenging. To prove that T. rex hunted, they needed to find signs of healing in an animal that had escaped an attack. This discovery is \"the piece that settles the controversy,\" said University of Kansas paleontologist David Burnham.\n\nThis doesn't mean T. rex only hunted and never scavenged. It's likely that it did both, like many large carnivores today. Thomas Holtz, a paleontologist at the University of Maryland, said that eating dead animals is \"food that doesn't fight back.\"\n\nThe hadrosaur vertebrae were found in South Dakota's Hell Creek Formation during a 2007 excavation. Further study revealed a cauliflower-like outgrowth on the vertebrae, which was a sign of bone healing. Then, researchers found the T. rex tooth crown wedged between the vertebrae.\n\nThe team used a CT scanner to image the tooth crown and compared it to other T. rex teeth. They also identified the vertebrae as coming from a hadrosaur's tail. This is consistent with how modern predators attack their prey, targeting the hindquarters first.\n\nNot everyone is convinced that this proves T. rex was a predator. Jack Horner, a Montana State University paleontologist, said that maybe the T. rex mistook the hadrosaur for carrion and then fled when it realized its mistake. The study's leader, Robert DePalma, called this scenario \"implausible.\"\n\nSince we can't observe dinosaurs in the wild, we'll probably never know whether T. rex preferred hunting or scavenging. But this new fossil provides a valuable snapshot of info about the behavior of these ancient creatures."

These are believed to be foundation holes for Tequesta Indian dwellings dating back 2,000 years. They also discovered linear arrangements of hundreds of postholes that may mark the foundation for other structures.\n\nThe village site is located on a two-acre city block where a developer, MDM Development Group, plans to build movie theaters, restaurants, and a 34-story hotel. The project would cover most of the block, including the full archaeological site.\n\nState and local historic-preservation officials are pressing the city to reconsider the Met Square plans to save part or all of the archaeological site. This could require a major redesign of the project, which could be costly for MDM.\n\nMDM has offered to carve out some of the limestone circles and display them in a public plaza. However, preservationists note that MDM knew the site was inside an archaeological zone when they purchased it 10 years ago.\n\nThe dilemma is similar to the battle to save the Miami Circle, another set of postholes discovered by Carr in 1998. After international pressure, the developer sold the property to the state for $27 million, and it has since been turned into a park.\n\nThe city's historic preservation board will receive an update on the finds and may debate what to do about the Tequesta site. Preservationists believe that saving the site could earn National Historic Landmark status and possibly even UNESCO World Heritage site designation.\n\nThe site is significant not only for its ancient history but also because it has artifacts from two later historic structures, including a well and artifacts from Fort Dallas and brick column bases from Flagler's hotel.\n\n\"It's extremely important,\" said city preservation board member Gerald Marston. \"If they gave it a name, it's the birthplace of Miami.\""

Officials say that in some areas, the water is safe to drink and wash with if people flush their systems first. But they warned that the water might still have a licorice smell, which worries some people who think it's still contaminated.\n\n\"I don't trust it,\" said Wanda Blake, a cashier at a Charleston Kmart who fears she was exposed to the tainted water before hearing about the spill. \"I know I drank it.\"\n\nBy Tuesday morning, officials had cleared about 35% of West Virginia American Water's customers to use their water again. The Thursday spill affected 100,000 customers in nine counties, or about 300,000 people.\n\nThe water crisis closed schools, restaurants, and daycare centers, and truckloads of bottled water were brought in from other states. People were told only to use the water for flushing toilets. Hospitals and schools flushed their systems and hoped to reopen soon.\n\nIn downtown Charleston, where the water was declared safe first, there were few signs of the crisis by Monday evening. Hotel guests were told they could use everything except the ice machines.\n\nBut many businesses in residential neighborhoods remained closed. Some people have filed lawsuits over the spill, and a fire station gave away free bottled water to those who needed it.\n\nFirefighters estimated that they had given away 2,500 cases of water by Monday afternoon - more than 80,000 bottles. They loaded several cases into every vehicle that drove through.\n\nInside the station, firefighters were eating frozen dinners because the tap water still smelled like licorice. One man, Bernard Casdorph, was making twice-daily trips to collect water for his family and neighbors.\n\n\"I just couldn't take it,\" he said after taking a shower despite the ban. \"I asked everyone if I was turning green or blue.\"\n\nOfficials were lifting the ban slowly to prevent overwhelming the water system and causing more problems. An online map showed which areas were cleared, but most of the nine counties were still under a \"do not use\" warning.\n\nCustomers were given 1,000 gallons of free water to flush their systems, which should be enough. The average residential customer uses about 3,300 gallons per month.\n\nThe crisis started Thursday when a chemical used in coal processing leaked from a plant into the nearby Elk River. Officials discovered that the source was a chemical called 4-methylcyclohexane methanol, which spilled out of a 40,000-gallon tank.\n\nAbout 7,500 gallons of the chemical are believed to have leaked, but it's not clear how much entered the water supply. Federal authorities have opened an investigation.\n\nTests showed that levels of the chemical were consistently below a toxic threshold, and some samples had no trace of it at all. Only 14 people exposed to the contaminated water were hospitalized, and none were in serious condition.\n\nThe chemical isn't deadly but can cause skin irritation, rashes, vomiting, and diarrhea.

However, some experts worry that this sheltered lifestyle has created a separation between the military and the nation it serves.\n\nThe Pentagon closed many domestic bases after the Cold War to save money and increase efficiency. Now, large bases like Camp Pendleton are more isolated, with communities dominated by military personnel and their families. This can create a sense of division in society.\n\nSome experts believe that this self-sufficiency adds to the feeling of a divided society. They argue that few Americans serve in uniform or share the sacrifices of those who do. The public has \"mentally outsourced\" issues of war and peace to the military, making them seem surprised when world events interrupt their daily lives.\n\nDespite these concerns, many at Camp Pendleton believe that upgraded living conditions helped families endure the strain of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. They argue that it's more like a family than living outside, with people understanding each other's struggles.\n\nMilitary families often feel that civilians don't comprehend their lives, including constant moving, long separations, raising children alone, post-combat mental disorders, and the fear of losing loved ones. Some spouses appreciate the safety and shopping on base but prefer to go off-base for a night out to avoid reflecting on their husband's reputation.\n\nThe economic impact on nearby Oceanside has changed over time. Initially, deployments caused a downturn in the local economy, but now families mostly shop on base. Officials argue that life inside the base isn't as separate as it seems, with many Marines living outside the gate and civilians allowed to visit for events like mud runs and paintball.\n\nOverall, Camp Pendleton has become more welcoming to civilians, with facilities open for corporate meetings and weddings. This shift towards supporting families is a positive change, making the base feel more like a community than just a workplace."

She believes that studying dogs can help us understand human development and learning disabilities.\n\nDogs are a good model for studying humans because they grow up in similar environments as children. They also pay attention to what we care about and know. Santos says that dogs might have been shaped differently from other animals because of their close relationship with humans.\n\nSantos is a professor of psychology who used to study monkeys. But she now thinks that dogs may be more useful for her research. Monkeys are good models for evolution, but they live in different environments and are raised differently than humans.\n\nDogs don't have language, but they grow up in the same environments as children and rely on similar cues. Santos wants to know how dogs think and learn in these environments.\n\nThe Canine Cognition Center is a new facility that studies dogs' decision-making processes and social cues. The center has about 300 dogs signed up for studies. Owners bring their dogs in for tests, which are usually simple problem-solving games.\n\nSantos says that studying dogs can help us understand human development and learning disabilities. She also thinks that dogs can tell us a lot about cognition and behavior.\n\nIn the past, researchers used dogs as models to learn about humans. But now, researchers are studying dogs because they're curious about how their minds work. One researcher, Erica Feuerbacher, says that recent studies of dogs are different from earlier ones because they're motivated by curiosity rather than just using dogs as a model.\n\nBrian Hare, an evolutionary anthropologist, says that dogs have been selected to be emotionally smarter. They like humans and want to be with them more than other dogs. He also says that studying dogs can help us identify the best dogs for jobs like guide dogs and detecting diseases.\n\nHare's interest in dog cognition was sparked by a game where food was hidden under a bucket. He realized that his dog could do it, but intelligent monkeys couldn't. This led him to explore other ways dogs have been underestimated.\n\nThe study of dog cognition has not been without resistance. Some researchers were hesitant to suggest that dogs could have obsessive-compulsive disorders or theory of mind. But now, these ideas are more accepted.\n\nSantos wants to know if dogs have theory of mind, which is the ability to recognize that others think differently than you do. Children develop this skill by age 3, and it's a milestone in cognitive development. Some studies have shown that children with autism score lower on theory of mind tests. Santos hopes that studying dogs can help us understand what goes wrong in the development of humans diagnosed with autism.\n\nOverall, Santos believes that dogs have a lot to tell us about cognition and behavior. By studying them, we can gain insights into human development and learning disabilities."

He did not directly mention \"child labor,\" but instead talked about \"sustainability.\"\n\nPage said that Cargill's goal is to make cocoa farming more productive and profitable, which would help reduce child labor abuses. The company has spent $5 million in the past three years on a program in Ivory Coast and Ghana to end child labor abuse.\n\nHowever, Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa believes that progress has been slow. He was behind a 2001 congressional action that put pressure on the cocoa industry to address child labor issues.\n\nThe cocoa industry committed $10 million for remediation efforts as part of a 2010 agreement. But Harkin says more investments are needed, and companies like Cargill need to be more engaged in the effort.\n\nCargill officials say they are among the leading investors in the fight against child labor. The company's program is designed to empower communities to take control of their own future, but progress will be incremental.\n\nThe cocoa industry has made some progress since the Harkin-Engel Protocol was signed in 2001, including creating child labor remediation efforts in 290 communities and reaching about 650,000 people. However, the industry fell short of its goal to develop criteria for certifying that cocoa is produced free from child labor.\n\nThe U.S. Labor Department has paid several million dollars to Tulane University to monitor child labor in Ivory Coast and Ghana. The university's final report in 2011 said that there was significant evidence of the impact of the Harkin-Engel Protocol, but also noted that funding for anti-child-labor issues had not been sufficient.\n\nCargill is working on its \"Cargill Cocoa Promise,\" which includes educating cocoa farmers and improving crop yields. The company's employees are trained to recognize signs of child labor, and they work with local leaders to address the issue.\n\nOverall, while progress has been made, there is still much work to be done to address child labor abuses in the cocoa industry."

The blast walls give an impression of division - inside the walls, the elite are safe, but outside it's every man for himself.\n\nArtist Kabir Mokamel returned to Kabul four years ago after living in Australia. He uses street art to highlight social problems in Afghanistan after decades of war. His group is called Art Lords, a reference to the warlords who dominate Afghan politics and are celebrated as heroes.\n\nMokamel wants people to think differently about what makes someone a hero. He says that instead of just celebrating fighters, they should also celebrate people who make their city better. Recently, his artists painted street sweepers on a concrete wall surrounding Afghanistan's secret service headquarters in Kabul. The mural reads \"The Heroes of My City: The Street Sweepers.\"\n\nPeople have responded positively to the art, with one day laborer saying it gives them a different perspective. Volunteer Maryam Kohi helps paint and says that corruption is a big problem in Afghanistan. She believes that the paintings can help spread an anti-corruption message.\n\nAfghan President Ashraf Ghani has also spoken out against corruption, calling it a \"cancerous lesion\" that threatens the state. Mokamel agrees and lists other social problems such as poor work ethics and street harassment of women.\n\nKabul's population has grown from 450,000 to 4.5 million, but infrastructure hasn't kept up. Mokamel hopes to bring back values of trust and friendliness that existed before the conflict. He returned to Kabul in 2010 after studying graphic art in Australia.\n\nThe Art Lords' work includes a series called \"healing the wounds of Afghanistan,\" featuring red hearts along a white wall. The next series will focus on suicide bombings, which have claimed many lives in recent weeks. Mokamel carries an official letter to show police who might think he's vandalizing property.\n\nThe first installment of street art appeared in July and featured a pair of beautiful eyes gazing out from the blast walls. It was a sensation among locals, who understood the message about corruption. While visual arts are returning to Afghanistan, little is accessible to ordinary Afghans, who are mostly poor. Fans of the Art Lords come back day after day to take part in painting.\n\nMokamel believes that street art can make a difference by changing how people think and feel. He says that when you put a brush stroke on a wall, it makes that much of the wall disappear."

SeaWorld Orlando is testing an app that lets guests buy select menu items ahead of time at Seaport Pizza.\n\n\"It's very convenient,\" said Cathy Valeriano, SeaWorld's vice president of culinary operations. \"It's definitely the wave of the future.\"\n\nTheme-park restaurants are just starting to offer online ordering compared with other restaurants. Chains like Panera Bread and Olive Garden already offer online ordering.\n\nRestaurants and theme parks say they're responding to consumers who want convenience. Another benefit is that it saves labor because fewer cashiers are needed, said Chris Muller, a hospitality professor at Boston University.\n\nShortening waiting times for attractions and rides is one of the biggest challenges for theme parks. But now they're focusing on reducing wait times in restaurants too.\n\nDisney declined to be interviewed but said in an email that the company is responding to changing guest expectations. Universal Orlando did not respond to requests for a comment.\n\nIn February, the Be Our Guest restaurant started accepting lunch reservations and allowing guests to preorder meals up to 30 days in advance. Diners pay upon arrival.\n\nIntroducing new technology to visitors can be tricky because people are on vacation and don't want to try to figure things out, said Robert Niles, editor of Theme Park Insider.\n\nThat's why tying features into a system like Disney's MyMagic+ would be wise, Niles said.\n\nDuring a recent lunch hour at SeaWorld, no one was picking up meals at Seaport Pizza's window for customers who preordered with the app. SeaWorld said it gets used more during peak vacation periods.\n\nSeaWorld is also introducing self-service kiosks where customers can order and pay with credit or debit cards. But many guests skipped that option and chose the cash-only line instead.\n\nBritish tourists Toni Crews and Simon Wilkin tried the electronic option and liked it, though. \"It was really easy,\" Crews said."

        "llama": "Evidence for a new geologic epoch is growing, like layers of sediment that harden into strata over time. Geologists studying the Earth's geologic time scale are debating whether to call this new era the Anthropocene. The term refers to a period where human activity has had a significant impact on the planet.\n\nJan Zalasiewicz, chair of the working group tasked with making a formal recommendation on the potential for a human-made epoch, says that the evidence is clear. \"This Anthropocene signal is global, it is sharp and all the signs are big.\" The working group has published their findings in the journal Science, arguing that the rapid increase in CO2 levels, deforestation, and other human activities have created a new geological phenomenon.\n\nThe current geologic epoch is known as the Holocene, which began around 11,700 years ago. However, since the mid-20th century, human activity has led to significant changes in the planet's climate, ecosystems, and geology. The rapid development of technology, population growth, and consumption of resources have expanded humanity's impacts on the environment.\n\nAs a result, the study authors argue that Earth has entered a new epoch that is \"functionally and stratigraphically distinct from the Holocene.\" Humanity has reconfigured the course of future evolution by shifting plants and animals around the globe or eliminating certain species. The Anthropocene may have begun as far back as the advent of farming or widespread burning of landscapes, but the most evident signs point to a new epoch that began around 1950.\n\nHowever, there is still debate within the geologic community about whether to formalize the Anthropocene as a new epoch. Some argue that it is too short in duration and may not be adequately recognized in geological successions. Others are concerned that the term may overestimate human influence or underestimate the impact of natural climate change.\n\nThe concept of the Anthropocene is not new, but it has been gaining attention in recent years. Some scientists argue that it is a useful tool for understanding the impact of human activity on the planet, while others see it as unnecessary or premature. Ultimately, the decision to formalize the Anthropocene will depend on further research and debate within the geologic community.\n\nThe working group's findings have sparked a wider discussion about the relationship between human history and geological time scales. Some argue that the two records are merging, and that it is sensible to switch over to a human timescale tied to some crossover point in recent rocks. Others see the Anthropocene as a young science that still needs to develop its ideas and gather feedback from the scientific community.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate about the Anthropocene highlights the complex relationship between human activity and geological time scales. While there is evidence for a new geologic epoch, there is still much to be discussed and debated within the scientific community before a formal recommendation can be made."

In track, she was a standout shot putter at the University of Illinois, but after college, she decided to try her hand at bobsledding.\n\nEvans' athletic ability and strength made her a natural fit for the sport, where she competes as a brakeman, helping to push the sled down the ice before jumping in and riding it out. Despite having no experience with bobsledding, Evans quickly rose through the ranks, winning two World Cup medals and setting start records on several tracks.\n\nEvans' success is due in part to her physical strength, which allows her to generate a lot of speed when pushing the sled. Her driver, Elana Meyers, says that Evans is \"built for bobsled\" because of her combination of strength and weight.\n\nDespite the challenges of the sport, including the risk of crashing and the physical demands of pushing the sled, Evans has proven herself to be a dedicated and resilient athlete. She has worked hard to develop her skills and has overcome setbacks, including the loss of her grandfather just before a major competition.\n\nEvans is now considered one of the top brakemen in the sport, and she is likely to compete in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Her success has inspired others, and she is seen as a role model for young athletes who are looking to try new sports and push themselves to excel.\n\nOverall, Aja Evans' story is one of hard work, determination, and a willingness to take risks and try new things. She is an inspiration to anyone who loves sports, and her success in bobsledding is a testament to the idea that with dedication and perseverance, anything is possible."

While some states have implemented policies to address these issues, others have not.\n\nConcussions are a major concern in high school sports, particularly in football. Many states have laws requiring schools to have concussion protocols in place, but implementation can be inconsistent.\n\nExtreme heat is also a significant risk for athletes, especially during summer training sessions. Southern states have taken the lead in adopting statewide heat policies, but Northern states may neglect this issue at their own peril.\n\nOveruse injuries are becoming more common as students specialize in specific sports and play them year-round. This can lead to serious injuries such as elbow and shoulder tears. Some schools have implemented policies limiting the number of pitches baseball and softball pitchers can throw, while others try to mandate training breaks for athletes.\n\nHeart conditions are another risk factor for high school athletes. An autopsy may reveal an underlying heart condition after a sudden death, but it's often unclear whether the condition was related to the athlete's death.\n\nThe National Athletic Trainers' Association recommends that schools have automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) on hand, but many laws don't require AEDs to be brought out to athletic fields. This can lead to delayed medical attention in emergency situations.\n\nExperts agree that adults, including parents and coaches, must take responsibility for preventing injuries in high school sports. By establishing limits and prioritizing athlete safety, we can reduce the risk of injury and ensure a healthier environment for young athletes.\n\nKey statistics:\n\n* At least 17 states have laws requiring or urging schools to have AEDs on hand.\n* There was a tenfold increase in UCL injuries between 1999 and 2004, followed by another sevenfold increase since then.\n* Many experts believe that overuse injuries are underreported due to lack of data.\n\nKey quotes:\n\n* \"If one of my recruits died under these circumstances, I'd be thrown in military prison.\" - Carlton Searcy\n* \"We all have a natural human competitiveness... but there needs to be controls on that.\" - Jeffrey Dugas\n* \"The more adults have become involved in youth sports, the more injuries have occurred.\" - Mark Hyman"

This includes 66% of African-Americans, 65% of white millennials, and 53% of Hispanics.\n\nThe study suggests that despite concerns that young people may not be getting their news from traditional sources, they are actually getting it from social media. Overall, 57% of millennials get news from Facebook at least once a day, and 81% do so at least once a week. The poll also found that Hispanics and African-Americans are just as likely to have paid news subscriptions as other millennials.\n\nThe study's findings contradict the idea that minorities would be adversely affected by a \"digital divide\" in terms of access to technology. In fact, minorities emerged among the biggest users of certain forms of technology, such as smartphones.\n\nThere was little difference between racial groups in terms of getting news from Facebook, but African-American millennials were more likely to comment on news stories posted to Facebook and use it to keep up with trending topics.\n\nAfrican-Americans and Hispanics are also more likely to get news from YouTube and Instagram than white millennials. According to Tom Rosenstiel, executive director of the American Press Institute, this is because these platforms allow users to produce content without gatekeepers.\n\nThe study found that streaming music or movies was the most common online activity among African-Americans, while keeping up with friends' activities was the most common among Hispanics.

They think it has something to do with how their brains handle speech when there's background noise.\n\nThe researchers looked at brain waves in children as young as 3 years old. They found that kids who have trouble recognizing specific sounds, like consonants, in noisy environments are more likely to have problems learning to read later on.\n\nIf this approach works, it could help identify which kids need extra help early on. This is important because connecting sound to meaning is a key part of reading. Kids who can match sounds to letters earlier tend to learn to read more easily.\n\nThe researchers used special equipment called an EEG to measure the brain's response to sound. They tested 112 children between the ages of 3 and 14. The results showed that the test could predict how well 3-year-olds would do on language development tests, as well as how they would perform on reading assessments a year later.\n\nThe study also found that older kids who struggled with reading had lower scores on the EEG test. This suggests that the test could be used to identify kids who might need extra help learning to read.\n\nThe researchers are excited about their findings, but they don't think EEGs will become a common tool for preschoolers anytime soon. The equipment is expensive and complicated, and more research is needed before it can be widely used.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the study is to develop a way to test how children's brains process sound at an even younger age - maybe even as part of routine newborn hearing screenings."

But Tibetan people have thrived there for thousands of years, and a new study says it's thanks to a genetic adaptation they inherited from an ancient human relative.\n\nThe study published in Nature identifies a long segment of DNA shared by the extinct Denisovans and modern-day Tibetans. The segment contains the gene that gives Tibetans an advantage at high altitudes.\n\nScientists collected blood samples from 40 Tibetans and sequenced more than 30,000 nucleotides on a segment of DNA containing EPAS1, the gene that makes Tibetans well-suited for life at high altitude. They compared that sequence with those of 1,000 individuals representing 26 human populations in the Human Genome Diversity Panel.\n\nThey found the high-altitude gene in only two of the 40 Han Chinese people in the panel and no one else. \"Natural selection by itself could not explain that pattern,\" said Rasmus Nielsen, a computational biologist at the University of California, Berkeley, and an author of the study.\n\nThe scientists investigated whether the gene might have been imported from extinct Neanderthals or Denisovans. They found a match in Denisovans. But how did the gene end up in the genome of modern Tibetans?\n\nThey used computer models to test two different hypotheses. Were Denisovans and Tibetans descended from a common ancestor that gave the gene to both? Or did humans acquire the gene by mating with Denisovans?\n\nIt's very unlikely that the gene could be maintained in both populations for so long, Nielsen said. Alternatively, the gene could have entered the Tibetan gene pool more recently via sex.\n\n\"Genetically, Han Chinese and Tibetans are very similar throughout the genome,\" Nielsen said. \"But for this particular gene, they are extremely differentiated from each other, which is something you only see with very strong or very recent selection.\"\n\nTibetans need EPAS1 because their mountainous home lies about 15,000 feet above sea level, on average. Up there, the air contains 40 percent less oxygen than low elevations.\n\nAlthough previous studies had identified the importance of EPAS1, scientists still don't know exactly what the gene does. They know only that it leads to lower levels of hemoglobin — the oxygen-toting protein in blood — in Tibetans who live at high altitude compared with people from low elevations who have acclimatized.\n\nPeople without the gene tend \"overreact\" at altitude, Nielsen said. As we acclimatize, we'll start to produce a lot of red blood cells, which can expose us to various diseases like hypertension, increased risk of stroke and pre-eclampsia.\n\nSo how do Tibetans get more oxygen? Presumably they don't, Nielsen said, and scientists are still trying to understand the physiological mechanisms that allow them to cope.\n\nBut one thing is now clear: They owe their extraordinary fitness to a rogue gene introduced into the human genome from their long-lost cousins."

Song downloads fell by 12 percent this year, while digital album sales were off 13 percent.\n\nIndustry insiders think streaming services are one reason for the decline. Mobile devices have become popular for listening to music, with 48 percent of smartphone owners using them daily for streaming and only 42 percent using them for downloading music.\n\nApple remains the largest manufacturer of smartphones, but more U.S. consumers now own Android devices running Google's software. As people switch to Android devices, they can't use Apple's iTunes anymore.\n\nApple has been meeting with label executives and artists to try to secure exclusive deals to boost sales. The company cites the success of Beyonce's album release in December as an example.\n\nHowever, not everyone agrees that withholding albums from streaming services is a good idea. Spotify Chief Content Officer Ken Parks said \"It just doesn't work for anyone.\"\n\nMusic industry analyst Mark Mulligan thinks that streaming services are attracting away Apple's most valuable customers."

        "llama": "There has been much discussion about raising the national minimum wage to $15 an hour. Some people see this as a way to reduce poverty and boost the economy, while others believe it will lead to job losses and economic downturn.\n\nIn recent years, several cities have adopted a $15 an hour minimum wage, including Seattle, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. Other cities, such as Chicago, Oakland, and Washington D.C., have also raised their minimum wages, but not as high.\n\nThe push for higher minimum wages is rooted in years of stagnant wages and a slow economic recovery since the Great Recession. Many Americans feel that corporations and wealthy individuals have benefited greatly from this period, while others have struggled to make ends meet.\n\nRaising the minimum wage would address some of this inequality by lifting millions of Americans out of poverty. According to Labor Department figures, nearly 60% of workers who are paid hourly - around 44 million people - currently make less than $15 an hour.\n\nHowever, the benefits from higher wages would be offset for many workers by a reduction in government benefits they receive, such as childcare subsidies or public aid for food, housing, and medicine. Additionally, businesses may pass on the increased labor costs to customers through higher prices.\n\nAn analysis by the Congressional Budget Office estimated that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour would result in around 500,000 jobs lost. At $15 an hour, the impact could be even greater.\n\nSome experts believe that a $15 an hour minimum wage may not be feasible for all areas of the country, particularly smaller businesses with thin profit margins. However, others argue that it could lead to improved productivity and increased sales as consumers pump more money into the economy.\n\nAs the push for higher minimum wages continues, workers and employers are already considering what life would be like in a $15 an hour world. The outcome is uncertain, but one thing is clear: raising the minimum wage will have far-reaching consequences for the national economy."

However, because they require their leaders to hold Christian beliefs, the group is fighting to preserve its religious identity.\n\nCalifornia State University (CSU) stripped InterVarsity of recognition because it refused to sign a nondiscrimination policy that requires clubs and organizations to open their memberships and leadership to all students. This means that groups that lose recognition can no longer use campus facilities for free or receive funding from the university.\n\nInterVarsity says that this policy is unfair and relegates them to second-class status. They argue that membership is open to everyone, but leaders must affirm the Christian faith. The group's national field director, Gregory Jao, says that a leader's religious belief is central to their identity, just like gender is for fraternity or sorority members.\n\nCSU officials say that they are bound by state law and university policy, which prohibits discrimination in any program funded by the state. However, some legal scholars argue that this policy reflects a broader move to water down differences and delegitimize religious thought.\n\nOther universities have also lost recognition for refusing to amend their bylaws. Some schools have created exemptions for religious groups, but CSU officials say that they cannot do so without legislation from the state.\n\nInterVarsity students are confident in their position and are exploring ways to continue promoting their message despite losing recognition.

Speakers encouraged the audience to get involved and fight for racial equality and harmony.\n\nRep. John Lewis was one of the speakers.

He acknowledged the progress made since King's speech but also noted that institutional barriers to success still exist, particularly for African-Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans.\n\nThe President emphasized the need for smart policies to support these communities and encouraged people to work together rather than being divided by politics."

However, synthetic DNA created in labs can still be patented.\n\nThis decision affects a Utah-based company called Myriad Genetics, which had patents on two genes associated with breast and ovarian cancer. The company used these patents to charge high prices for genetic testing, limiting access to this information.\n\nNow, other companies can develop their own tests using the same genes, which should lead to lower costs and better quality. This could also affect thousands of other human genes that have been patented.\n\nThe court's decision is a mixed bag for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. While it limits what they can patent, it still allows them to protect their lab-created DNA and methods for isolating genes.\n\nMyriad Genetics says the ruling won't hurt its business much because it has many other patents and inventions. However, scientists and lawyers say this decision could have far-reaching consequences for genetic research and testing.\n\nGenes are segments of DNA that define our traits and can influence whether we develop certain conditions.

Even though she only started watching hockey a few years ago, she's become devoted to the sport.\n\nSecor is one of a growing number of minorities who are becoming fans of hockey. In the past, hockey has mostly been watched and played by white people. But according to the National Hockey League (NHL), that is slowly changing. There are more minority players in the NHL now than there were in the past. The Blackhawks have three black players, which is the most of any team.\n\nThe NHL says it doesn't specifically target certain ethnic groups with its programs. Instead, it tries to grow interest in the game by reaching out to young people in urban communities. In Chicago, the Blackhawks winning games has helped get more people interested in hockey.\n\nHowever, there are still some barriers that make it hard for people of color to get into hockey. For example, there aren't many places where people can learn how to play, and the cost of equipment and ice time can be expensive. But there are efforts underway to develop interest in the sport among minorities. For example, there are youth hockey leagues that do outreach to local minority children.\n\nSome fans say that having more minority players in the league would help attract more diverse fans. Others point out that it's hard for people to learn about and get interested in hockey if they can't afford to go to games or watch them on TV.\n\nDespite these challenges, there are many people of color who are passionate about hockey. For example, Vic Ortiz is a Mexican-American man who loves watching the Blackhawks. He says he didn't used to be able to afford to go to games, but now he tunes in whenever they're playing.\n\nGertrude Johnson is an African-American woman who started watching hockey five years ago.

They argue that state law requires employers to make reasonable accommodations for their workers' religious practices.\n\nHowever, King County Superior Court Judge Mary Yu dismissed the lawsuit last year, saying state law does not require employers to accommodate religious practices. The Supreme Court agreed to take the case due to its importance and potential impact on future lawsuits.\n\nThe case has been closely watched by legal groups, with some arguing that failure to recognize a religious discrimination claim under state law would leave a gaping hole in coverage. Others believe that the protection is implicit in state law.\n\nA decision in the case could shift some lawsuits from federal to state court, set the standard for accommodation employers must make, and allow workers to sue smaller employers. The Supreme Court's ruling will guide lower courts in deciding similar cases in the future.\n\nThe issue of religious accommodation has been on the rise since the September 11 attacks, with more employees asserting their religious identities at work. A poll by the Tanenbaum Center for Interreligious Understanding found that common conflicts involved working on a religious holiday or attending company events where food did not accommodate dietary restrictions.\n\nThe Washington statute was passed 15 years before the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and has not been amended to provide for reasonable religious accommodations in the workplace. While the Human Rights Commission has published guidelines and investigated complaints, most attorneys file employment-discrimination cases in federal court due to a lack of clarity in state law.\n\nSimilar cases have been seen across the country, with some employers settling lawsuits brought by employees who were fired or discriminated against due to their religious practices."

But the current outbreak in West Africa, which is happening near several countries’ borders, has spread widely and become a global problem.\n\nTo stop the outbreak, at least 50% of all infectious Ebola patients in West Africa need to be isolated so they can’t infect others. This number comes from two new studies by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Eurosurveillance. If this doesn’t happen, the outbreak might be reduced but won’t stop, and could continue to spread for years.\n\nCurrently, each sick person with Ebola makes about two more people ill. The World Health Organization says there are 7,178 cases of Ebola and 3,338 deaths so far. Projections suggest that if efforts to contain the epidemic aren’t increased, the death toll could reach tens of thousands. In a worst-case scenario, Sierra Leone and Liberia alone could have up to 1.4 million cases by mid-January.\n\nIncreasing resources from international forces can help reduce the number of Ebola patients, but it won't be enough unless at least 50% are contained. Smaller reductions will give communities time to prepare and maybe develop a vaccine, but the longer it takes, the more likely areas that are currently Ebola-free could become infected again.\n\nThe incubation period for Ebola is between two and 21 days, after which people show symptoms and can spread the disease. However, it's clear that the disease can be contained - Senegal and Nigeria have already stopped the spread of Ebola. But if the disease isn't fully contained soon, other factors could make things worse: no one knows how long immunity to Ebola lasts, so recovered patients might get sick again next year.\n\nEbola is a serious virus, but it's not as easily passed between people as some other diseases. There's no sign that it's becoming more virulent. The 1918 Spanish flu, which killed over 30 million people worldwide, had a higher reproductive rate than Ebola. Studies have shown that the reproductive rate of Ebola has remained relatively consistent across outbreaks.\n\nThe CDC estimates that perhaps 70% of patients need to be isolated to alter the course of the epidemic. The second case of Ebola diagnosed in the US highlights the global threat and the importance of containing it. \"We can't make the risk zero until the outbreak is controlled in West Africa,\" says CDC Director Tom Frieden."

The crew is now doing at least 50 hours of science work per week, up from just three hours a week in 2008. Research includes Earth observation, the study of cosmic rays, and the effect of spaceflight on astronaut health.\n\nFiguring out how space affects humans will be especially important if NASA ever plans an expedition to Mars. Astronauts have been doing shifts onboard the station for over a decade, building a database of health history for space travelers.\n\nFormer NASA astronaut Leroy Chiao said that the station is an invaluable tool in helping NASA find ways to combat bone loss, muscle atrophy, and other ailments caused by spaceflight. He added that four extra years could help solve some mysteries, including why some astronauts develop vision problems after extended stays in orbit."

They decided it was time to take strong measures.\n\nThe 5,000 residents of this former lumber town are now on strict water rations. A family of four can use no more than 150 gallons a day. Outdoor watering is banned. Businesses have been ordered to cut their water use by 35 percent.\n\n\"We realized the situation is very serious,\" said Adrienne Moore, Willits City Manager.\n\nCalifornia may be headed for another big drought like in the late 1980s and early 1990s or even worse than 1977. The snow and rain could still come but if sunny weather continues the state will face water shortages.\n\nSome areas have enough stored water to last through this year, including Southern California and San Francisco. But other places that rely on local rivers and lakes may run out of water.\n\nFarmers who grow lettuce and vegetables in Imperial County will get their regular share of water from the Colorado River. Growers with senior water rights on two major rivers won't have more than a 25 percent cut in irrigation deliveries.\n\nBut ranchers, communities relying on surface supplies and farmers on the San Joaquin Valley's south and west sides may face big problems.\n\n\"I worry what will happen if it doesn't rain,\" said Carre Brown, a supervisor in Mendocino County. \"All our reservoirs are very low.\"\n\nWillits officials plan to apply for emergency state funding to develop alternative water sources. They may use well water or tap into a local lake.\n\nResidents have already cut back on their water usage before the rationing went into effect.\n\n\"The people here are good at conserving water,\" Moore said.\n\nHowever, one group that could be a problem is marijuana growers who use a lot of water. If they don't cut back, enforcement officers will address the situation.\n\n2013 was California's driest calendar year in 119 years but from a hydrological and water supply perspective, the state is just now entering drought. Gov. Jerry Brown declared a drought emergency on Friday.\n\nThanks to storms in late 2012, last year wasn't as bad as it could have been. But storage in major reservoirs is below average and dropping when it should be rising.\n\nThere's always a chance that weather could change but for now the state faces water shortages."

That was until he started volunteering at a juvenile hall in Los Angeles.\n\nBudnick began teaching creative writing classes to teenagers who were awaiting trial for serious crimes such as murder and armed robbery. He was inspired by their stories and backgrounds, and saw an opportunity to make a positive impact on their lives.\n\nOne of the programs Budnick implemented was a container garden project, where the teens could plant and care for vegetables and herbs outside their dorms. This taught them empathy and responsibility, and provided a sense of hope in a bleak environment.\n\nBudnick's work at the juvenile hall led him to become an advocate for juvenile justice reform. He began taking formerly incarcerated young people to Sacramento to lobby legislators, and had several successes, including the passage of a bill that granted parole board reviews to prisoners who were sentenced to life without parole as juveniles.\n\nIn 2013, Budnick founded the Anti-Recidivism Coalition, a nonprofit organization that provides services for recently released prisoners, including support groups, yoga classes, and help with college applications. The organization has received funding from major donors and has been recognized for its work.\n\nBudnick's efforts have also earned him personal recognition. In 2012, he was named California's Volunteer of the Year by Governor Jerry Brown. Last year, he was appointed to the Board of State and Community Corrections, and in June, he was honored as a \"champion of change\" by the White House.\n\nBudnick has continued to stay involved with the young men he met at the juvenile hall, visiting them in state prisons across California. He has also taken his celebrity friends, including Zach Galifianakis and Ed Helms, to visit former students in prison.\n\nRecently, Budnick left his production company to form a new entertainment business that focuses on social justice. He wants to use film as a way to raise awareness about important issues and inspire change.\n\nOverall, Scott Budnick's story is one of redemption and purpose. He has found a new passion in life by working with at-risk youth and advocating for justice reform. His work has had a positive impact on countless lives, and he continues to be a driving force for change."

The next year, his students repeated their feat, as they did the following years. This seemed like a small achievement compared to Americans' annual attempt to predict winners in the tournament.\n\nHowever, things changed when Quicken Loans announced a $1 billion prize for anyone who correctly called every game. Chartier became a \"rock star\" in the national media, quantifying odds and offering expertise to those trying to win the prize.\n\nChartier's 11-year-old son, Noah, even asked his dad to help him with his own bracket, saying, \"Daddy, it's a billion dollars!\" Chartier joked that if they won, he would take $1 million a year for 40 years, and Noah could have the rest. However, the odds of winning are extremely low.\n\nJeffrey Bergen, another mathematician, calculated the odds of creating a perfect bracket: 1 in 9 quintillion. However, he notes that if you know something about basketball, your odds improve to 1 in 128 billion. Even then, it's like predicting 31 coin flips in a row.\n\nIn reality, the chances of winning are so low that it's unlikely anyone will take home the prize. John Diver, who runs ESPN's Tournament Challenge, agrees that the Quicken/Buffett contest is likely just a publicity stunt. He notes that not even close to a perfect bracket has been achieved in 17 years of hosting their own online contest.\n\nIt's likely that only a few people will have perfect brackets after the first round, but none will remain by the end of the second day. Diver jokingly suggests offering a $1 trillion prize to \"one up\" Buffett."

But this story happened before he became famous. It also took place before the communist state was created, a government Klemke sometimes disagreed with.\n\nThis is a story that Klemke never told. Dutch documentary filmmaker Annet Betsalel discovered it when she looked through old records of the Jewish community in Bussum, Netherlands.\n\nBetsalel found out about a network set up by Sam van Perlstein, a Jewish businessman who knew Jews were living on borrowed time under Nazi occupation. Van Perlstein and his friends created fake documents to help Jews survive.\n\nJohannes Gerhardt, a young German soldier, became friends with Mels de Jong, whose wife was van Perlstein's daughter. Gerhardt asked Klemke for help in creating the fake documents. Klemke made perfect documents that fooled everyone who needed to be fooled.\n\nKlemke created many more fake documents, including birth certificates, food ration coupons, and ID cards. He did this despite being a member of Nazi Germany's army.\n\nYears later, Klemke became famous for his artwork. But he never talked about his actions during the war. His friend Harald Kretzschmar said that made sense because Klemke was a humble man who didn't like to brag.\n\nKlemke kept letters from Jews he had helped save in case he ever faced prosecution for being a Nazi soldier. When someone asked him about it, he simply said: \"I only did what any man should have done.\"\n\nThe German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung noted the irony that Klemke kept quiet about his actions in the resistance.\n\nKlemke believed in the power of his work. He wanted to create stories that would make children happy and bring light into their lives. His artwork was fanciful, fun, and thoughtful.\n\nEven under a dictatorship, artists like Klemke created beauty and humor."

The sanctions mainly affect producers in the Carolinas and Southern states who export to Russia.\n\nThe US exports over $1 billion worth of agricultural products to Russia each year, including chicken and turkey from North Carolina, Texas, and Mississippi. While Russian sales are not a major part of US farm exports, they still matter for some farmers.\n\nMike Cockrell, chief financial officer for Sanderson Farms, a large poultry producer and exporter, said that although the sanctions will have an impact, his company can find alternative markets for its products.\n\nTyson Foods, another major poultry and meat exporter to Russia, also expects the impact of the sanctions to be minimal. The company says it can absorb the loss by selling its products in other global markets.\n\nThe US had expected Russian retaliation after increasing sanctions against Russia last month. Sanderson Farms has been actively seeking new markets for its dark chicken and turkey meat before the announced retaliation.\n\nWhile the poultry ban may hurt US exporters, it ultimately affects Russian consumers who rely on imported food. The US did not impose sanctions that could harm ordinary Russians, so Russia's move is seen as ironic.\n\nRussia has used poultry imports as a political weapon in the past, which led some US poultry companies to avoid doing business with them. The current ban may lead to lower profits for US poultry exporters if they all try to sell their products to the same buyers."

This is the same bear that was given to an American publisher in 1947 by Christopher Robin himself, saying he had grown up.\n\nSince then, the bear has been kept at the New York Public Library. The English are now asking for it back because Winnie-the-Pooh represents a special idea of childhood in England.\n\nThe Times newspaper in London recently wrote about this issue.

The paper argued that the bear should be returned to England, where it belongs.\n\nThis isn't a new issue - even former Prime Minister Tony Blair brought it up with former President Bill Clinton. The Times suggested building a special museum in East Sussex for Winnie-the-Pooh and his friends.\n\nHowever, there is some irony in this argument. Similar arguments were made by Greece about the Elgin Marbles, which are statues taken from the Parthenon in Athens and now kept at the British Museum.

Fewer than 400 undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral botany degrees were awarded in 2012. Educators say this is because students are choosing more modern majors like technology.\n\nCurrent botanists fear that there will be fewer people to teach about, identify, and use plants. This could harm conservation efforts and the development of alternative fuels and medicines. Universities struggling with budget cuts are also closing herbaria - collections of plant species used by botanists.\n\nJoe Miller of the National Science Foundation says, \"We won't understand what we have in the world. Only 20% of plant and animal species have been identified.\"\n\nIn Arkansas, researchers are searching for a threatened annual called the Missouri bladderpod. There are only 75 populations of this species in the world, and all are close to urban centers.\n\nTheo Witsell, a botanist with the Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission, hopes to conserve some of the glades where scientists are still finding new plant species. He says that as people retire, there will be fewer qualified botanists to replace them.\n\nWitsell also notes that if we can name a plant, we understand its biology, and can use it for medical purposes. For example, Quinine is a malaria treatment found in cinchona trees.\n\nHerbaria are important resources for botanists, but many are closing or consolidating due to budget cuts. The University of Missouri recently donated its 200,000 plant specimens to the Missouri Botanical Garden.\n\nThe University of Arkansas at Fayetteville herbarium narrowly escaped closure in 2003, and the University of Arkansas at Little Rock closed its collection a few years later.

He wanted to make a difference and started making hand-lettered signs that tell the stories of each person's struggles.\n\nTodd approached homeless people in April asking if they wanted new signs, and some accepted his offer. He spent two months creating 20 signs, which took anywhere from five to 10 hours to complete. The signs have been documented on Todd's blog \"The Urban Type Experiment\" and quickly went viral.\n\nSome of the sign recipients reported an increase in donations, while others didn't notice a difference. One homeless man, Mike Droney, said he often gets compliments on his sign but can't say for sure if it has helped him get more money.\n\nUlysses White, another recipient, said his new sign has definitely resulted in more charity. White served two tours in Iraq and his sign mentions his service before asking for help.\n\nTodd's project is not the first of its kind. In 2011, a man named Christopher Devine printed and laminated signs for homeless people in Chicago. Devine's signs were simpler than Todd's and read \"Homeless\" or \"Please Help.\"\n\nDevine said he printed nearly 700 signs over four years but stopped distributing them a few months ago. He was happy to see Todd's project and believes that the signs are eye-catching and help increase visibility for the homeless population.\n\nHowever, Ed Shurna, executive director of the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless, said that while the revamped signs may help some, Chicago's homeless problem requires systemic action. He added that 6,000 people fill the city's shelters each night and that Gov. Bruce Rauner's budget priorities would reduce care services for poor people and exacerbate homelessness.\n\nTodd graduated from design school in May and moved to Los Angeles for an advertising internship. He said he may start making signs for California's homeless population in the future."

The virus, called Tobacco ringspot virus, was first discovered in soy crops but now it is infecting honeybees.\n\nHoneybees are important for pollinating about 90 crops worldwide, worth $14 billion annually. However, many of these colonies have been collapsing due to a combination of pathogens, pesticides, and stress on their immune system.\n\nOnly a few plant viruses can be transmitted by pollen and even fewer have jumped from plants to insects. This makes the forces driving colony collapse disorder more complex.\n\nThe Tobacco ringspot virus is special because it replicates in a way that creates many mutations. This helps it evade the host's immune response, which could explain why some viral infections keep coming back.\n\nResearchers found the virus in every part of the bee except its eyes. They also found that varroa mites carry the virus but are not infected themselves. The researchers think that the mites help spread the virus within the colony.\n\nThe study suggests that the Tobacco ringspot virus could be contributing to the collapse of honeybee colonies. However, more research is needed to understand how much it contributes compared to other factors like pesticides and nutritional deficits.\n\nActivists have raised concerns about a class of pesticides called neonicotinoids, which have been linked to suppressed immune response and increased reproduction of viruses in bees. Other studies have found many pesticides and fungicides in pollen collected from bees.\n\nThe US Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency have identified pesticides, pathogens, and nutritional deficits as major factors behind colony collapse disorder."

Authorities say a couple carried out the attack, with the wife pledging allegiance to ISIS.\n\nObama said that while there was no evidence the shooters were directed by a terror network overseas or part of a broader plot, \"the two of them had gone down the dark path of radicalization.\" He called it an act of terrorism designed to kill innocent people.\n\nThe President's speech was likely to leave his critics unsatisfied. He announced no significant shift in US strategy and offered no new policy prescriptions for defeating ISIS.\n\nObama did call for cooperation between private companies and law enforcement to ensure potential attackers cannot use technology to evade detection. He also urged Congress to pass new force authorization for military actions underway against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, and to approve legislation to bar guns from being sold to people on a no-fly list.\n\nHe implored Americans not to turn against Muslims at home, saying ISIS is driven by a desire to spark a war between the West and Islam. He called on Muslims in the US and around the world to take up the cause of fighting extremism.\n\nThe President's most specific policy announcement was to order the departments of State and Homeland Security to review the fiancé visa program that the female shooter in California used to enter the US.\n\nHe also reiterated his call for broader gun control legislation, saying no matter how effective law enforcement and intelligence agencies are, they can't identify every would-be shooter. He called it a matter of national security to prevent potential killers from getting guns.\n\n\"What we can do, and must do, is make it harder for them to kill,\" he said.\n\nObama stands little chance of getting the Republican-led Congress to agree to any gun control measures. On Thursday, the Senate rejected legislation barring people the government suspects of acts of terror from purchasing firearms.\n\nCongress also has been unable to coalesce behind any plan to authorize more force against ISIS, and the administration's proposal has languished since February.\n\nThe President repeated his long-standing opposition to an American-led ground war in the Middle East and made no mention of the more aggressive action others have suggested.\n\n\"Our success won't depend on tough talk, or abandoning our values or giving in to fear,\" he said. \"Instead, we will prevail by being strong and smart, resilient and relentless.\"\n\nThe President's critics — and increasingly, some members of his own party — have questioned his strategy.

Linn Naing owns his sidecar, so he doesn't have to pay a daily fee to rent it.\n\nBurmese bicycle sidecars are made of wood and have two seats, one facing forward and one backward. They were invented by a mechanic named Mg Nyeit about 85 years ago as a cheaper way to travel than trains.\n\nZaw Zaw Co, a Yangon artist, thinks sidecars are both practical and meaningful. \"They're useful for carrying things home from the store or going to small streets that buses can't reach,\" he says.\n\nIn 2011, Zaw Zaw Co started painting sidecars on his canvases. He wanted to show the working class struggling with life. Most of these drivers do this job because they're uneducated and don't have many choices.\n\nTo get inspiration for his paintings, Zaw Zaw Co rides on sidecars aimlessly through the city streets. \"I just relax my mind and try to take in the experience,\" he says."

        "llama": "PHILADELPHIA — Some small shapes found in fossils have been called “oblong blobs.” Scientists think they might be the remains of ancient pigment granules. These could give clues about the colors of dinosaurs with wings.\n\nBut a new study by Alison E. Moyer, a Ph.D. student at North Carolina State University, has proposed a different explanation. The shapes could simply be impressions left by very old bacteria.\n\nThe size and shape of these “microbodies” do not rule out either interpretation, says Moyer. She is the lead author of a paper published in Scientific Reports.\n\nMoyer’s study has gotten a lot of reaction on social media from other researchers. Some agree with her, while others disagree. One researcher who disagrees is Matthew D. Shawkey, an associate professor at the University of Akron. He said on Twitter that Moyer's research was \"bad science.\"\n\nShawkey had several objections to Moyer’s paper. One of them was that two images in the paper were not scaled correctly. The images showed bacteria on a chicken feather and similar-shaped impressions found in a fossil feather from a dinosaur.\n\nMoyer counters that the bacteria are closer to twice the length of the fossil impressions. However, it is hard to tell who is right just by looking at the images.\n\nThe size of the purported melanosomes falls within the range of known bacteria, Moyer said. This makes it difficult to rule out either interpretation.\n\nChemical analysis of the fossil feathers has also been inconclusive, she said.\n\nWhile Shawkey disagreed with Moyer’s paper, another scientist who has interpreted the shapes as pigment granules had a more receptive attitude. Johan Lindgren, an associate professor at Lund University in Sweden, said that it is always good to take a step back and look for more data.\n\nScientists have concluded that some dinosaurs were black, gray or brown based on the shape of the fossilized imprints. However, Moyer says there is still much work to be done to confirm this."

His teacher thought that his homemade clock was a bomb.\n\nAhmed got to go to the White House after what happened to him. But he also got suspended from school for three days, even though it was just a clock. Many people think that this shows how schools are too harsh when punishing students.\n\nMany US schools started being very strict in the 1990s. But now some of them are starting to be more lenient. Instead of suspending or expelling students, they try to talk to them and help them understand what they did wrong.\n\nSome school districts have changed their policies on discipline. New York, Los Angeles, and Denver schools do not automatically suspend students anymore. Connecticut has limited the number of times a student can be suspended from school, and Texas no longer considers truancy a criminal offense.\n\nThe Obama administration has also asked schools to stop sending kids to court for misbehaving. Instead, teachers should learn how to resolve conflicts peacefully.\n\nDenver Public Schools started a new program in 2008 that focuses on helping students understand why their behavior was wrong instead of just punishing them. The district found that minority students were being suspended and expelled more often than white students.\n\nOne student, Margarita Atencio, was suspended and then expelled from school after other girls beat her up and blamed it on her. She had to repeat seventh grade and felt like nobody cared about her.\n\nEldridge Greer runs a program for the Denver district that helps students who get into trouble. He said that before the new policy, there were 11,500 out-of-school suspensions and 167 expulsions in one school year. Last year, those numbers went down to 5,400 suspensions and 55 expulsions.\n\nBefore the change, students would get suspended for things like shouting matches. Now, they might meet with a school official instead to talk about what happened.\n\nDaniel Kim works with an organization that helps students who have been affected by harsh discipline policies. He said that while things are getting better, minority students are still more likely to be punished than white students.\n\nOutgoing US Education Secretary Arne Duncan said last month that suspensions and expulsions often affect minority students more than others."

The study was published on Monday by four economists from China, the US, and Israel.\n\nThe researchers looked at data from 90 Chinese cities from 1981 to 2000 and compared it with death rates from 145 locations across the country from 1991 to 2000. They found that a government policy from the Mao era caused big differences in air quality between north and south China.\n\nIn northern China, people were given free coal for heating during winter, while those in southern China did not get this benefit. This created two groups that could be compared with each other, showing how burning coal affected air quality and health.\n\nThe researchers found that the level of tiny particles in the air was 55% higher in northern China than in southern China. They also found that life expectancy in northern China was 5.5 years lower due to more deaths from heart and lung problems.\n\nThe study estimated that the 500 million people living in northern China in the 1990s lost a total of 2.5 billion years from their lives because of bad air quality. The researchers are calling for stricter laws to reduce pollution, saying it's a huge loss for public health.\n\nAir pollution remains a big concern in China, with episodes of severe smog causing widespread problems. In January, a spell of bad weather and high emissions led to some of the worst air pollution on record, forcing highways to close and people to stay indoors.\n\nThe Chinese government has taken steps to address the issue, including closing factories and limiting car use during emergencies. However, critics say that these measures are not enough and that economic growth should be sacrificed for cleaner air.\n\nOther studies have shown that reducing particulate matter by 100 micrograms per cubic meter could add three years to life expectancy. Chinese citizens would be willing to give up some economic growth to reduce pollution, according to one of the researchers.\n\nThe study looked at levels of total suspended particulates (TSP) measured in the 1980s and '90s. More recent studies have focused on smaller particles called PM2.5, which are considered more damaging to health.\n\nIn January, PM2.5 measurements reached over 1,000 micrograms per cubic meter in some parts of northeastern China, much higher than the US national standard. A study by Greenpeace and Peking University researchers estimated that PM2.5 pollution caused over 8,500 premature deaths in four Chinese cities in 2012.\n\nThe researchers are calling for stricter standards for factories, gasoline, and heating to reduce pollution and save lives."

In England, the Royal Horticultural Society has also reported an alarming shortage of skilled professionals in the field.\n\nHorticulturists say the problem has been building for decades due to globalization, urbanization, and a loss of connection to the land.

The suit also asks for new labels on the snack to reflect that it contains GMOs.\n\nGMOs are foods that have been changed in a lab using DNA from other plants, animals, or bacteria. Some people think they might be bad for you, while others don't think so.\n\nThe FDA doesn't officially define what \"natural\" means when it comes to food labels, but the agency says that if a food doesn't contain added colors, artificial flavors, or synthetic substances, then it can be labeled as natural.\n\nLeo's lawyer, Joshua Eggnatz, says that Leo bought the snacks because she thought they were natural and didn't contain GMOs. She would have chosen cheaper options for her family if she had known about the GMO ingredients.\n\nPepperidge Farm officials did not comment on the lawsuit.\n\nThe debate over GMOs is a big issue in the US right now.

The U.S. trucking industry has called for a 65-mile-per-hour national limit, as well as electronically governed trucks that cannot exceed that limit.\n\nLaw enforcement officers like Sergeant Jake Hicks are still working to enforce speed limits and keep drivers safe. While he acknowledges that the higher speed limit hasn't changed his job much, he notes that many highway patrol officers have lessened the cushion they allow motorists to exceed the new 80-mile-per-hour limit.\n\nAs one driver learned the hard way, speeding can be costly - both in terms of safety and in terms of getting a ticket."

        "llama": "WASHINGTON — A teenager who survived a rare form of liver cancer is now helping scientists understand the disease. Her efforts have led to a discovery that might help explain how this type of tumor grows.\n\nAt age 18, Elana Simon of New York City has become an author of a study in the journal Science. She wanted to learn more about the extremely rare liver cancer that mostly affects adolescents and young adults.\n\nElana's father, Sanford Simon, is a scientist who helped her with the project. He says it's a small study, but it could lead to more research on this disease. The team found an oddity in genetic material that might fuel cancer growth.\n\nThe teen-spurred project has grown into work to get more patients involved in scientific research. Scientists at the National Institutes of Health are advising Elana and her father on how to set up a patient registry.\n\nElana was diagnosed with liver cancer at age 12, but surgery was able to remove the tumor. She knows other patients who weren't so lucky. She wondered why not try to study this type of cancer using computer science skills she learned in high school.\n\nThe team found it hard to get enough tumors to test because only about 200 people worldwide are diagnosed with this disease each year. But Elana's surgeon and patient groups helped collect tissue samples, which were then analyzed at the New York Genome Center.\n\nThe study found a weird mutation that might play a role in how the tumor grows. More research is needed to see what this gene flaw really does."

        "llama": "Alejandra Pinzon was a high school student in Overland Park, Kansas, but she wasn't like other students. She was an undocumented immigrant, brought to the US by her parents when she was a child. After graduating from high school, Alejandra faced a difficult decision: stay in the US and risk deportation or return to Mexico, a country she barely knew.\n\nIn 2010, Alejandra decided to leave the US and move back to Mexico City. She had heard that it would be easier for her to get into college there, but things didn't work out as planned. The Mexican government wouldn't validate her US high school diploma because of a bureaucratic issue with her name.\n\nAlejandra ended up getting a job at a call center, taking customer service calls from the US. One day, she received a call from a woman in Overland Park, and they chatted about their shared hometown. Alejandra felt a pang of homesickness.\n\nIn 2012, President Barack Obama announced the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which would allow young undocumented immigrants like Alejandra to stay in the US without fear of deportation. But it was too late for Alejandra; she had already left the country.\n\nAlejandra's sister called her with the news, and Alejandra felt a wave of regret. She realized that if she had stayed in the US, she might have been able to take advantage of the DACA program and pursue her dreams.\n\nNow, Alejandra is stuck in Mexico, feeling like she made a mistake by leaving the US. She still hopes to attend college one day and maybe even return to the US legally. But for now, she's trapped in limbo, unsure of what the future holds.\n\nAlejandra's story highlights the complexities and challenges faced by undocumented immigrants who are brought to the US as children. They often face difficult decisions about their education, career, and personal lives, all while navigating a complex and unforgiving immigration system."

The court decided 6-3 against a law passed by Congress in 2002.\n\nThe State Department has long had a policy of not listing Israel as the birthplace for people born in Jerusalem. This is because the U.S. government does not recognize any country's control over Jerusalem until Israelis and Palestinians resolve the issue through negotiations.\n\nJustice Anthony Kennedy wrote that the president has the power to decide which foreign countries are recognized by the U.S., and this includes what a passport says.\n\nThe ruling ends a 12-year lawsuit brought by Menachem Zivotofsky, who was born in Jerusalem, and his parents. They wanted him to be able to list Israel as his birthplace on his passport.\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia disagreed with the decision. He said Congress and the president share responsibility for foreign affairs.\n\nThe case has come at a time of tension between Israelis and Palestinians over Jerusalem. The U.S. government has long avoided recognizing any country's control over the city, despite pressure from Israel to do so.\n\nIn fact, President Barack Obama has expressed doubts about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's commitment to creating a Palestinian state. Netanyahu has criticized the U.S. for its role in international negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program.\n\nThe status of Jerusalem is one of the most difficult issues in relations between Israelis and Palestinians. Israel has controlled all of Jerusalem since 1967 and considers it its capital, while the Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of their own state.\n\nKennedy began his opinion by noting the tensions surrounding Jerusalem. \"A delicate subject lies in the background of this case,\" he said."

        "llama": "President Barack Obama announced a series of measures Tuesday to protect parts of the world's oceans. The plan includes creating a marine sanctuary that would close a large area of the central Pacific to fishing and energy development.\n\nThe president said pollution, overfishing, and acidification of ocean water are major problems. \"Rising levels of carbon dioxide are causing our oceans to acidify,\" Obama said in a televised statement. \"Pollution endangers marine life. Overfishing threatens whole species.\"\n\nObama's plan requires federal agencies to take steps to address these problems. The plan also includes expanding the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument southwest of Hawaii. This would limit fishing and energy development over a larger area of ocean.\n\nThe Obama administration can make this change without congressional approval, but it will first have a public comment period. Environmental groups say the expanded protections could go into effect this year.\n\nSome people are opposed to the plan, including House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Doc Hastings. He said the president is taking too much power and that oceans should be open for economic activities like fishing and energy production.\n\nThe plan also includes creating a task force to combat seafood fraud and illegal fishing. The White House says about one-fifth to one-third of wild-caught seafood imported to the U.S. may be illegal.\n\nAnother part of the plan is to improve monitoring of ocean acidification, which is caused by increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This can harm marine life like coral reefs and shellfish beds."

        "gpt": "NASA sent a new robotic spacecraft, called LADEE, to the moon late Friday. It launched from Virginia, creating a spectacular show for people along the East Coast.\n\nShortly after launch, the spacecraft had some equipment issues. On Saturday, NASA said LADEE was safe and on the right path to the moon. However, they need to fix the problem within two to three weeks. \n\nPeter Worden, who leads NASA's Ames Research Center in California, said he is confident the issue will be fixed soon. The problem happened when LADEE's reaction wheels, which help balance and steer the spacecraft, shut down. The computer turned them off because they were using too much power. Worden said the wheels might have been spinning too fast, but there is no big rush to fix it.\n\nLADEE’s mission is to study the moon’s thin atmosphere and dust. It launched on an unmanned Minotaur rocket just before midnight from Virginia’s Eastern Shore. NASA’s launch team cheered and tweeted, \"We are headed to the moon!\" \n\nThis launch was special because NASA usually sends moon missions from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The Virginia launch gave people along the East Coast a rare chance to see the rocket lighting up the sky. NASA encouraged people to share photos online, and many pictures came in from cities like New York, Boston, and Washington, D.C.\n\nLADEE will take a long route to the moon, circling Earth three times before entering lunar orbit. Unlike the fast Apollo missions, which took three days to reach the moon, LADEE will take about a month. It should arrive by October 6. \n\nThe spacecraft, about the size of a small car, will study the moon’s atmosphere and see if dust rises from its surface. This $280 million mission will last six months and end with LADEE crashing into the moon.\n\nLADEE also carries new laser communication technology. This could allow NASA to send data faster and use smaller, more energy-efficient devices in the future. NASA hopes to use laser communication for future missions to places like Mars, where high-definition videos and 3D images will be needed.\n\nThe launch was a big moment for Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. It was their first mission to deep space. Wallops usually handles smaller launches into Earth’s orbit. NASA used this site because of the Minotaur V rocket, which is made from old Air Force missile parts. A treaty limits how many places these rockets can launch from.\n\nMost of NASA’s moon missions, including the famous Apollo flights, launched from Florida. The last moon mission was the twin Grail spacecraft, launched two years ago. Another moon mission, Clementine, launched from California in 1994.\n\nWallops will soon be in the spotlight again. On September 17, the Orbital Sciences company will send supplies to the International Space Station using its Antares rocket and Cygnus capsule."

        "gpt": "PITTSBURGH — Teaching students how to solve problems without violence and giving them better access to mental-health help are some of the best ways to stop school violence, officials say. This includes tragedies like the one at Franklin Regional High School in Murrysville, Pennsylvania.\n\nHowever, progress has been slow because schools lack money, use safety programs that don’t work, and don’t train staff and students well enough.\n\n\"We’re 15 years after Columbine, and you’d think we would have fixed this problem,\" said John Matthews, head of the Community Safety Institute in Texas. He referred to the 1999 school shooting in Colorado, where two students killed 12 classmates and a teacher before taking their own lives.\n\nA study from Vanderbilt University suggests that teaching young students how to solve conflicts and think before acting could help reduce violence. The study looked at 27 school safety programs and talked with young people in Nashville who had experienced violence. Manny Sethi, a researcher and trauma surgeon, said it’s better to teach these skills before high school. \"By high school, it’s much harder to change behavior,\" he said.\n\nAlong with teaching conflict-resolution skills, many people believe schools need to improve mental-health services. \"There are a lot of kids in pain in our schools,\" said Beverly Kingston, head of the Center for the Study of the Prevention of Violence. She said starting programs to teach social and emotional skills in preschool could make a big difference.\n\nAfter the stabbings at Franklin Regional, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett said schools should focus on mental health. But school staff in Pennsylvania said budget cuts have reduced the number of counselors, social workers, and psychologists who can help students. Julia Szarko, president of the Association of School Psychologists in Pennsylvania, said schools are the first place where students can get mental-health support, but there aren’t enough staff to meet the need.\n\nFor example, the Philadelphia School District cut all its school counselors last year to save money. Steven Berkowitz, a mental-health expert, said politicians often talk about mental-health support after school tragedies, but they don’t pass laws or provide funding to make changes. \"They say the right things, but they don’t pay for it,\" he said.\n\nU.S. Representative Tim Murphy has been pushing for a new law to improve mental-health services. His plan includes making it easier to get psychiatric care through regular doctors and pediatricians. Murphy said school violence usually builds up over time, giving schools chances to help students before a crisis happens.\n\nSchools have tried many ways to improve safety, like anti-bullying programs, zero-tolerance policies, metal detectors, and anonymous tip lines. But some of these don’t work, said Sethi. His team tested a program in a Nashville middle school where students practiced role-playing to learn how to avoid violence. For example, they acted out situations like being called a name or having someone flirt with a friend’s boyfriend or girlfriend. After the program, students said they were less likely to hit others, cheer for fights, or be bullied.\n\nEven when schools identify students who need help, they often don’t get long-term support, said Matthews. He mentioned the case of Seung-Hui Cho, the shooter at Virginia Tech in 2007. Cho received help at home but lost that support when he went to college.\n\nMatthews also said schools often use generic safety plans instead of ones specific to their needs. They also don’t train staff and students enough. For example, schools should practice for emergencies that could happen at the start of the school day or in gyms and cafeterias. \"The staff training is minimal, and for students, it’s even worse,\" he said.\n\nAlicia Chico, a social worker, said there are ways to train staff and spot troubled students, but teachers often don’t have time. \"Teachers are with students the most, so it should start with them. But they already have so much to do,\" she said.\n\nCirecie West-Olatunji, president of the American Counseling Association, agreed that teachers need more training and help from mental-health professionals. She also said counselors, social workers, and psychologists should spend more time walking through schools and building relationships with students and their families."

        "gpt": "TUCSON, Ariz. — A tragic accident at an Arizona shooting range has started a big debate. A 9-year-old girl accidentally shot and killed her instructor while learning to use a fully automatic Uzi. Now, people are questioning if kids should be allowed to handle such powerful guns.\n\nGun experts are also asking a different question: What's the right way to teach kids about guns? \n\nButch Jensen, a shooting instructor in Tucson for 10 years, says it's up to each family to decide if their child should learn to shoot. He believes proper training is very important. Guns, he says, are tools, like kitchen knives or power tools, and they need to be used safely. \n\nJensen watched the video of the accident and said, \"You don’t start a beginner with a gun like that. It’s like learning to race cars—you don’t start with an Indy car.\"\n\nThe instructor who died, Charles Vacca, was 39 years old and from Lake Havasu City. The accident happened at the Last Stop outdoor range in northern Arizona, near Las Vegas. A video shows the girl losing control of the gun after Vacca showed her how to use it. The fatal shot is not shown in the video. The girl and her parents have not been named.\n\nThe Arizona workplace safety agency is investigating the case. Police have said no charges will be filed.\n\nJensen works at a shooting range near Tucson that doesn’t rent guns or allow fully automatic shooting. There’s no age limit at his range, but kids under 16 must be closely watched by a parent or guardian. That adult doesn’t have to be a trained instructor.\n\nBlake Carrington, an Air Force member, was at the range and said he has taught his 10-year-old daughter to shoot a small .22 rifle. But he would never let her use a fully automatic gun. \"I feel terrible for that little girl. She has to live with this,\" he said.\n\nCarrington isn’t sure if there should be stricter gun laws for kids. \"Guns only do what the person holding them decides,\" he said. \"Bad decisions lead to accidents.\"\n\nFederal law says kids under 18 can’t own guns, but there’s no federal rule stopping kids from using them. Arizona is one of 21 states where kids can use guns if an adult is present. In contrast, 28 states and Washington, D.C., have laws limiting kids' access to guns. For example, Connecticut doesn’t allow kids under 16 to handle machine guns. This law was created after an 8-year-old boy died in 2008 while firing an Uzi at a gun show.\n\nLindsey Zwicker, a lawyer who studies gun laws, said accidents like this often lead to discussions about changing the law. \"People look at what went wrong and think about how to prevent it in the future,\" she said.\n\nAt the Tucson range, another shooter, Tom, said he worries this accident will fuel arguments for stricter gun control. \"Anti-gun people will use this to create panic about kids and guns,\" said Tom, a 66-year-old attorney who didn’t want to give his full name. \n\nTom said he supports teaching kids about guns but thinks letting a 9-year-old use an Uzi was a bad idea. \"I don’t know what the adults were thinking,\" he said. \"Kids under 15 shouldn’t handle submachine guns.\"\n\nAt another gun range in Tucson, instructor Sean Yeandle said no one under 18 is allowed to shoot an Uzi there. At his range, kids must be at least 10 and supervised by a parent. Instructors always stand behind shooters to help control the gun, especially since guns can push back hard when fired. \n\nYeandle said teaching a child to shoot an Uzi is not worth the risk. \"It’s just too dangerous,\" he said."

        "gpt": "FERGUSON, Mo. — For the first time in 120 years, Ferguson’s City Council will have three Black members. However, Tuesday’s election wasn’t a clear win for all the volunteers who worked hard to influence voters.\n\nOne big change in this election was the turnout. About 30% of the city’s 12,738 registered voters participated, much higher than the usual 12%.\n\nStill, the higher turnout didn’t help two candidates supported by protesters: Bob Hudgins and Lee Smith. Hudgins, who is a protester and independent journalist, lost to former Mayor Brian Fletcher in the 2nd Ward. Fletcher, who started the \"I Love Ferguson\" campaign, said, \"I guess people still see value in experience.\"\n\nSmith, a retiree, lost to Wesley Bell in the 3rd Ward. Bell is a municipal court judge in nearby Velda City.\n\nIn the days before the election, many volunteers knocked on doors to support Bell and Smith. They were backed by groups like Missourians Organizing for Reform and Empowerment and the Service Employees International Union. Patricia Bynes, a local Democratic leader, helped manage their campaigns.\n\nFerguson is 67% Black, but before the election, only one of the six council seats was held by a Black member, Dwayne James. That’s about to change. In the 1st Ward, Ella Jones won nearly 50% of the vote in a four-way race. Jones, who leads the city’s Human Rights Commission, said she ran because of how she saw police treating young Black men. She raised more money than her opponents, with help from a $7,000 donation.\n\nUsually, elections in Ferguson don’t have much competition or turnout. But after Michael Brown’s death, protests, and federal investigations, this election was different. Eight candidates ran for three council seats, and the election drew attention from media across the country.\n\nOn Tuesday, a thunderstorm hit as voting began. At one polling place near where Brown was killed, only about 10 people had voted by 9 a.m. LaRhonda Wilson worried about low turnout, saying, \"The world is watching.\"\n\nDespite the rain, some voters like Sharon Bell-Price showed up. She said this election was especially important because of all the tension in Ferguson. Issues like Brown’s death, court practices, and racial profiling influenced her vote. \"I’m hopeful we’ll get the change we need,\" she said.\n\nThe rain seemed to help candidates seen as part of the \"establishment\" more than those wanting big changes. Some had criticized local courts for unfair practices, but Bell’s role as a judge didn’t hurt him. His campaign manager, Dan Peterson, said their success came from knocking on doors and talking directly to voters.\n\nMayor James Knowles, who wasn’t up for re-election, attended Bell’s victory party but didn’t comment on the results. Knowles could face a recall effort soon, as some residents want him removed from office.\n\nThe new council will take over during a tough time. The city manager and police chief recently quit after a federal investigation found the police department violated people’s rights and used courts to collect money unfairly.\n\nAs the polls were closing, Bell and Smith were still trying to win over voters. Bell, who supports community policing, said the next police chief must be well-prepared for the job."

        "gpt": "Income inequality is getting worse in the United States, and it is a bigger problem than many people think. Growing up in poverty can harm a child's brain development, making it harder for them to do well in school. A study in *JAMA Pediatrics* showed this connection.\n\nWe already know that kids from low-income families often perform worse in school. Recent studies also found that poverty is linked to smaller brain surface areas. This new study shows that about 20% of the gap in school performance between rich and poor kids might be because of differences in brain growth.\n\nThe study looked at 389 healthy kids and teens aged 4 to 22. Psychologist Seth Pollak and his team at the University of Wisconsin–Madison compared test scores with brain scans. They used MRI machines to measure gray matter in parts of the brain important for learning, like the temporal lobes, frontal lobes, and hippocampus. These areas are sensitive to a child’s early environment. Some kids were studied again after two years and followed for up to six years.\n\nThe study found that kids from families below the poverty line had 8–10% less gray matter in their brains compared to normal development. Kids from families just above the poverty line also had less gray matter, about 3–4% below normal. However, there wasn’t a big difference between middle-class and wealthy kids. This shows that having more money doesn’t always lead to better brain development, but very low income can seriously harm it. Pollak explained that the human brain can handle a lot of challenges, but extreme poverty pushes it beyond what it can manage.\n\nPollak hoped that the brain gap would get smaller as kids grew older and spent more time in school. But the gap was still there at age 22.\n\nTo focus on how poverty affects the brain, the researchers left out kids with other problems, like family mental health issues or complicated pregnancies. The results were clear: even healthy kids growing up in poverty showed these effects. Joan Luby, a psychiatrist at Washington University, said this study made an important connection between poverty and school performance. She believes it gives a clear plan for improving public health.\n\nIn 2013, a report showed that 51% of kids in U.S. public schools came from low-income families. These kids often face more stress, like less healthy food, unsafe neighborhoods, and stressed parents. Pollak’s team hopes future studies will find out how programs like free school lunches or housing help poor kids. Pollak now sees poverty not just as a social issue but as a health problem, like an environmental toxin harming children."

        "gpt": "NEW YORK — A New York City commuter train went off the tracks on Sunday, killing four people and injuring over 60. The crash happened as the train rounded a riverside curve, throwing passengers from the cars and leaving the wreckage near the water.\n\nAbout 150 passengers were on the early morning Metro-North train traveling from Poughkeepsie to Manhattan. Around 7:20 a.m., many were jolted awake by screams and the feeling of the train tipping over. Four or five of the train’s seven cars derailed on a curve in the Bronx where the Hudson and Harlem rivers meet. This was the first time passengers had died in the 31-year history of the railroad, which is the second largest in the U.S.\n\n\"Four lives were lost today, right after Thanksgiving,\" said Governor Andrew Cuomo. Eleven people were critically hurt, and six others were seriously injured, according to the Fire Department. The train’s operator was also injured.\n\nGovernor Cuomo said the tracks seemed fine, so speed might have caused the crash. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the Federal Railroad Administration sent investigators to figure out what went wrong. Officials said they would examine the train, the tracks, the signals, the train crew, and the train’s speed.\n\nThe speed limit for the curve is 30 mph, but the train may have been going much faster. A passenger, Frank Tatulli, told a TV station that the train felt like it was moving \"a lot faster\" than normal as it approached the sharp turn near the Spuyten Duyvil station.\n\nThe train wasn’t full at the time, rail officials said, with some passengers likely heading to the city for holiday shopping. Joel Zaritsky, heading to a dental convention, said he woke up as the train car rolled over. \"I saw gravel coming at me, and I heard people screaming,\" he said. \"There was smoke everywhere. People were thrown to the other side of the train.\"\n\nNearby residents heard the crash. Angel Gonzalez, in his apartment overlooking the tracks, thought it was a plane crash. Mike Gallo, walking his dog, said he \"knew it was a tragedy right away\" when he saw injured people climbing out of the train.\n\nEmergency crews arrived quickly. They helped passengers on stretchers, some in neck braces. Others held ice packs to their heads. Firefighters broke windows to rescue people and used tools to check for anyone trapped under seats or debris. Police divers searched the water to ensure no one was thrown in.\n\nThree men and one woman died. Three victims were found outside the train, and one was found inside. Their names were not released yet. Federal investigators planned to turn the train cars upright to make sure no one was still trapped.\n\nGovernor Cuomo said the wreck looked like \"a toy train set mangled by some super-powerful force.\" Officials said the crash could have been much worse if it had happened on a weekday or if the lead car had fallen into the water.\n\nFor years, the NTSB has urged railroads to install safety systems that can prevent crashes caused by speeding. A 2008 law gave railroads until the end of 2015 to install these systems, called \"positive train control.\" These systems use GPS and computers to monitor trains and prevent accidents caused by human error, which is behind about 40% of train crashes. However, the systems are costly and complex, and railroads are trying to delay the deadline.\n\nMetro-North is working on installing such safety systems. Currently, it uses a system that applies brakes if a train is going too fast, but it cannot stop the train completely. Experts said it’s unlikely the crash was caused by brake failure since trains have automatic systems that stop them if the brakes lose pressure.\n\nTrain service between New York City and Albany was delayed but resumed later on Sunday. It’s unclear when Metro-North’s Hudson line will fully reopen. Officials were planning alternate transportation for Monday morning commuters.\n\nThis was the second Metro-North passenger train derailment in six months. In May, a train derailed in Connecticut and was hit by another train, injuring 73 people. Eleven days later, a Metro-North worker was killed by a train. In July, a freight train derailed near the same area as Sunday’s crash.\n\nState Sen. Jeff Klein said, \"Safety is clearly a problem on this stretch of track.\" Earlier this month, Metro-North’s chief engineer admitted that the railroad was behind on maintenance in some areas, including where the May derailment happened. The NTSB has urged Metro-North to use extra safety measures, like alert systems in work zones, to prevent future accidents."

        "gpt": "CHICAGO — On Sunday, Nik Wallenda walked on a tightrope high above Chicago and broke two world records. Many people thought his stunt was too dangerous because he didn’t wear a safety harness, but he still succeeded.\n\nWallenda, who is 35 years old, walked more than two city blocks over the Chicago River. He started at the Marina City west tower and ended at the Leo Burnett Building. The walk, which was slanted at a steep angle of 19 degrees, took him 6 minutes and 51 seconds. This set a record for the steepest tightrope walk between two buildings.\n\nAfter finishing that walk, Wallenda went back to the west tower. This time, he wore a blindfold and crossed over to the east tower. He did this more than 500 feet above the ground, setting a record for the highest blindfolded tightrope walk.\n\n\"You probably think I’m crazy, but this is what I was born to do,\" Wallenda said as he started his first walk.\n\nPolice said more than 50,000 people came to watch him. Wallenda didn’t use a harness or a safety net, which made the stunt even more thrilling. While walking, he often talked to the crowd cheering below.\n\n\"Listen to that noise,\" he said. \"I love Chicago, and Chicago loves me.\"\n\nWallenda was about 630 feet above the river, which is as tall as the Gateway Arch in St. Louis. He walked against the wind but said it wasn’t too bad.\n\n\"The cable is moving a little, but it’s not a problem,\" he said.\n\nThe Discovery Channel showed the event on TV with a 10-second delay. If Wallenda had fallen, they planned to stop the broadcast. Wallenda had trained to grab the wire and hold on if he slipped. He said he could hang there for 20 minutes while waiting for help. His rescue team could reach him in about 90 seconds.\n\nThe stunt had some last-minute changes. The cable was supposed to be at a 15-degree incline, but due to weather problems, it was set at 19 degrees instead.\n\nMany people came to watch the event in person. Nikki and Rich Ross brought their 7-year-old son Jake to see it. They arrived early, brought chairs, and ate sandwiches while waiting. Rich said they had seen Wallenda’s Grand Canyon walk on TV, but being there in person was much more exciting.\n\n\"It’s amazing to see this live instead of on TV,\" Rich said. \"It’s something you only see once in a lifetime.\"\n\nJake said he was excited to see Wallenda walk blindfolded. He also likes practicing tightrope walking, even though he’s scared of heights. Rich wasn’t worried about Wallenda falling.\n\n\"They have to make sure everything is safe before he walks,\" Rich said. \"It is a little windy, though.\""

But now, things have changed.\n\nThe football has been exciting, with lots of goals and amazing moments. Neymar helped Brazil shine, Robin van Persie scored an incredible header, and Lionel Messi showed his magic at the Maracana stadium. On Monday, Thomas Mueller scored three goals for Germany in a big 4-0 win over Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal. Clint Dempsey scored for the U.S. just 30 seconds into their 2-1 win against Ghana. And this is only the first round of games.\n\nSmaller teams have also surprised everyone. Costa Rica made a great comeback to beat Uruguay, and Switzerland scored a last-minute goal to win against Ecuador.\n\n\"Every game has been exciting, with lots of open play and beautiful goals,\" said Paul Rolleman, a Dutch fan, enjoying the sunshine on Rio's famous Copacabana beach.\n\nBefore the tournament, people worried about unfinished stadiums and protests. Many thought this World Cup, returning to Brazil after 64 years, might be a disaster. But with 44 goals in just 14 games and few protests, it could be one of the best tournaments in decades.\n\n\"Fans want to see goals,\" said U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann. And they are getting them. From Sao Paulo to Salvador, and from Brazil’s interior to Rio’s beaches, goals are pouring in. The World Cup is averaging over three goals per game, which could make it the highest-scoring tournament since Brazil won its first title in 1958.\n\nOnly one game, Nigeria vs. Iran, ended in a 0-0 draw. Fans booed because they’ve been spoiled by all the goals. It seems everyone is inspired by \"Jogo Bonito.\" No team is playing defensively or \"parking the bus,\" as Europeans say.\n\n\"Every game has been fun to watch,\" said German fan Andre Lien, though he was sad to be heading back home for work.\n\nBrazil’s coach, Luiz Felipe Scolari, has been bold, using three strikers. The Netherlands destroyed Spain, the defending champions, 5-1 with fast, attacking football. Even Bosnia, playing in their first World Cup, gave Argentina a tough match, just as their coach Safet Susic promised. \"This is how we play,\" he said. \"We don’t know any other way.\"\n\nFans are loving the fun atmosphere. On Monday morning, a group of German men played football in tight swimsuits on Copacabana beach before heading to watch the games.\n\nBut it’s still early. Organizers need to stay alert. At the opening game in Sao Paulo, part of the stadium lights flickered on and off, causing a brief scare. Luckily, the lights stayed on, and Neymar scored twice to help Brazil win 3-1 against Croatia.\n\nThere have been some protests and problems. In Rio, police clashed with protesters near Maracana stadium while Messi scored for Argentina. In Natal, heavy rain and floods have caused trouble.\n\nStill, the tournament has been thrilling so far. Brazil’s only worry now is whether the excitement can last for a full month.\n\n\"It’s a big party,\" said Dutch fan Rolleman on Copacabana beach. \"But I really need some sleep now.\""

        "gpt": "TAHIRPUR, India — At first, Ashok Yadav didn’t worry about the pink patches on his arm. But when pale sores appeared on his body and he couldn’t feel his fingertips, a doctor gave him the shocking news: Yadav had leprosy.\n\n\"Life turned into a nightmare,\" said Yadav, who has lived in Kasturba Gram, a leprosy colony near New Delhi, for 30 years. \"I lost my job. My parents thought I would ruin my sisters’ chances of getting married. They wanted me to leave home.\"\n\nEven though India has made progress against leprosy, the disease still carries a strong stigma. Leprosy is not very contagious and is not deadly, but fear of it is stopping efforts to get rid of it completely. \n\nMany people hide their diagnosis from family and friends because they are scared of being rejected. Employers often refuse to hire people who had leprosy, even if they are cured. Some people can’t get driver’s licenses or other basic documents. Even children of leprosy patients, who don’t have the disease, are treated unfairly.\n\n\"We suffer every day,\" said Neelawati Devi, a long-time resident of Kasturba Gram, where 10,000 people live, including many children of leprosy patients. \"Our children are teased at school,\" she said, showing her bandaged hands where her fingers used to be. \"But we want them to study and get good jobs. Their future should not be ruined.\"\n\nHealth centers in India are running campaigns to teach people that leprosy is the \"least contagious disease.\" Health workers explain that leprosy doesn’t spread through normal contact and is not passed down from parents to children.\n\nBut the disease’s visible effects, like disfigured hands and feet, add to people’s fear. Leprosy is a bacterial infection that can stay hidden for years. It attacks the nerves, causing numbness. Over time, hands and feet curl inward, and injuries go unnoticed because there is no pain. Fingers and toes are often lost because of untreated sores. Scientists think it spreads through sneezing or coughing after long-term contact with someone infected, but they are not completely sure.\n\nLeprosy, also called Hansen’s disease, has been curable since the 1940s with antibiotics. If caught early, the worst effects can be avoided. Most people, about 95%, have a natural immunity to it.\n\nGlobally, new cases of leprosy have dropped from 10 million in 1991 to about 230,000 last year because of better treatment efforts. In India, hospitals use a mix of drugs to kill the bacteria that causes leprosy. \n\nIn 2005, India declared success against leprosy, reporting less than one case per 10,000 people. But some areas, like Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Bihar, and West Bengal, still struggle. \n\nIn 2012-2013, India found 134,752 new cases, slightly more than the 127,295 cases the year before. India accounts for 58% of new leprosy cases worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. The disease is also a problem in Brazil, China, Indonesia, and East Timor.\n\nC.M. Agarwal, a health official, says the rise in cases is because of better reporting by health workers. But activists disagree. They believe the leprosy program lost focus after the 2005 declaration and that resources were shifted to other health issues. \n\nLeprosy’s long incubation period—sometimes 5 to 15 years—also makes it hard to track. By the time symptoms show, the disease may have already spread to others, said P.K. Gopal, who works with leprosy patients.\n\nThe government is trying to fight leprosy by sending more health workers to 209 high-risk areas in 16 states. But the stigma and suffering remain for patients and their families.\n\n\"Our children shouldn’t have to live under the shadow of leprosy,\" said G. Venugopal, a community elder in Kasturba Gram. \"At school, people insult them, calling them the children of lepers. The kids don’t want to go to school, and we have to force them.\"\n\nChanging people’s attitudes is hard, said Gopal, who has worked with leprosy patients for over 40 years. \"The fear of leprosy is so strong that people avoid getting treatment. This hurts the success of the leprosy program.\"\n\nVenugopal and others are asking the government to increase disability payments for leprosy survivors. \"We get 1,800 rupees ($29) a month, which is very little,\" he said. \"It doesn’t even cover the cost of bandages for our sores.\"\n\nUttam Kumar, another resident, said he was thrown out of his home because neighbors didn’t want a leprosy patient nearby. He spent months homeless before finding shelter in Kasturba Gram’s small one-room homes. \n\n\"Here, we are all the same,\" Kumar said. \"Everyone has their own struggles, but we share the same pain.\""

        "gpt": "SEATTLE – A few years ago, my wife Melinda and I visited rice farmers in Bihar, India. This area often floods, and the farmers there are very poor. They rely on the rice they grow to feed their families and make a living.\n\nEvery year, when the monsoon rains come, rivers rise and threaten to flood their fields. The farmers hope their crops will survive, but often they don't. When their crops are destroyed, they go to cities to find small jobs to earn money. But by the next year, they return to their farms, usually poorer than before, and try again.\n\nThis visit showed us how hard life is for the world's poorest farmers. They have no safety net. Unlike farmers in richer countries, they don’t have good seeds, fertilizer, irrigation, or crop insurance. One bad event – like a flood, drought, or illness – can push them deeper into poverty and hunger.\n\nNow, climate change is making things worse. Rising temperatures will cause big problems for farming, especially in tropical areas. Crops may fail because of too much or too little rain. Warmer weather will also help pests grow, which can destroy crops.\n\nFarmers in richer countries will face challenges too, but they have better tools and support to handle them. Poor farmers, however, often have nothing. This means they will suffer the most from climate change.\n\nAt the same time, the world needs these farmers to grow more food. By 2050, the world will need 60% more food to feed everyone. If harvests get smaller, it will increase hunger and undo the progress made in reducing poverty over the past 50 years.\n\nI believe we can avoid the worst effects of climate change and still feed the world – but we must act now. Governments need to invest in clean energy to reduce greenhouse gases and slow rising temperatures. But it's already too late to stop all the effects of climate change. Even if we find a perfect energy solution tomorrow, it will take time to switch from fossil fuels. This is why we must also help poor farmers adapt to the changes.\n\nFarmers need basic things like better seeds, fertilizer, training, and places to sell their crops. They also need new tools designed for a changing climate. At the Gates Foundation, we’ve helped develop seeds that survive droughts and floods. For example, farmers in Bihar now grow a type of rice called \"scuba rice.\" It can survive underwater for two weeks, helping them prepare for floods. Other types of rice are being created to handle drought, heat, cold, and salty soil.\n\nThese improvements can change lives. Farmers who use better tools and seeds often double or triple their harvests and incomes. With more money, they can eat better, invest in their farms, and send their children to school. They also feel safer, even if a harvest goes bad.\n\nClimate change will bring new problems we can't predict. To prepare, the world needs to speed up research on seeds and tools for small farmers. One exciting idea is using satellite technology. In Africa, scientists use satellite images to create soil maps. These maps help farmers know what crops will grow best in their fields.\n\nHowever, good seeds and tools only help if farmers can use them. Groups like One Acre Fund are helping farmers get what they need. This group works with over 200,000 farmers in Africa, providing loans, tools, and training. By 2020, they aim to help one million farmers.\n\nIn our Annual Letter this year, Melinda and I made a bet that Africa can feed itself in the next 15 years. Even with climate challenges, I still believe in that bet.\n\nPoor farmers face many challenges. They need to plant the right seeds, use the right fertilizer, get training, and sell their crops. If one thing goes wrong, their lives can fall apart.\n\nBut I believe the world can help fix these problems, both now and in the future. And most importantly, I believe the farmers can succeed if they get the support they need."

        "gpt": "CHICAGO — On Monday, Mayor Rahm Emanuel began his second term as Chicago's mayor. In his speech, he focused on one big issue: the lack of opportunities for young people in poor neighborhoods.\n\nEmanuel barely mentioned another big problem: the city’s money troubles. Chicago’s credit rating is very low, and its pension funds don’t have enough money. In the coming weeks, Emanuel will ask state lawmakers for help with pensions and to allow a Chicago-owned casino to bring in more money.\n\nSecond-term speeches are often tricky for leaders. They usually talk about what they’ve done so far and what they plan to do next. But Emanuel chose to focus only on helping Chicago’s disadvantaged children and teens. Critics have said he is a mayor for the rich and not for everyone. His speech seemed to address that.\n\nEmanuel talked about kids growing up in poverty, without good schools, and at risk of turning to crime. He said Chicago must face this problem, even though it’s hard to talk about.\n\n\"Today, as we start the next four years, I want to focus on stopping another generation of kids from being lost,\" he said in his speech at the Chicago Theatre.\n\nThe mayor shared stories about programs that help kids and mentioned Marcus Norris, a young man who overcame challenges. Marcus was hit by a stray bullet when he was nine, losing four teeth. He didn’t smile for years until a program called Becoming a Man helped him gain confidence and get dental surgery. Now, Marcus is graduating high school and dreams of becoming a chef.\n\nEmanuel said more needs to be done. He talked about young people who feel invisible until they end up involved in violence. \"We must not ignore them,\" he said. \n\nWhile Emanuel focused on youth, many people were expecting him to talk about the city’s financial problems. Chicago and its schools each face billion-dollar deficits. A recent court ruling made fixing the city’s pension problems harder. Some Wall Street agencies downgraded Chicago’s credit rating to \"junk.\" Emanuel also has to negotiate with teachers to avoid a strike, and the city’s schools chief is under investigation for a contract deal.\n\nEmanuel only briefly mentioned money issues, saying he would keep working on them. Some city leaders noticed this. Alderman Scott Waguespack said, \"It was a nice speech, but he didn’t address pensions or finances. We need a plan for the city’s money problems.\"\n\nOther leaders felt Emanuel’s focus on youth was important. Alderman Joe Moore said, \"The crisis facing our young people is a huge challenge, and it was the right time to talk about it.\"\n\nEmanuel thanked his wife, children, and parents during his speech. He also thanked former President Bill Clinton, who attended the event and got a big round of applause.\n\nMost of Emanuel’s speech was about Chicago’s children. He didn’t share many new ideas but said helping young people should be a top priority for everyone in the city. \"Over the next four years, I will do everything I can to bring hope and opportunity to every Chicagoan,\" Emanuel said. \"But I challenge every citizen to do their part, too.\"\n\nAlderman George Cardenas said it was smart for Emanuel to focus on motivating the city instead of finances for now. \"This was about inspiring young people to take control of their future,\" Cardenas said.\n\nThe City Council will turn its attention to financial issues on Wednesday. Many of these problems have been around since Emanuel became mayor four years ago. Alderman Tom Tunney said the city still has \"unfinished business\" from Emanuel’s first term, especially with pensions. He called for teamwork between the city, state, and federal governments to solve these issues."

        "gpt": "Sepp Blatter, the longtime president of FIFA, said on Tuesday that he would step down. This surprised many because he had just been re-elected a few days earlier and criticized U.S. investigators looking into corruption at FIFA, the organization that runs world soccer.\n\nIt’s not clear why Blatter decided to resign, but investigators say he is still part of their ongoing investigation. They hope to get evidence from people who have already been arrested. No new charges were announced on Tuesday.\n\nAt a short press conference in FIFA’s headquarters in Zurich, Blatter said he had done nothing wrong. However, he admitted he had lost the trust of the soccer world. He called for a new election to choose his replacement. Until then, he will remain president and work on making big changes at FIFA.\n\n\"I care about FIFA and soccer more than anything,\" said Blatter, who is 79 years old and has been president since 1998. \"FIFA needs a complete makeover.\"\n\nBlatter’s call for big changes, like setting term limits for leaders and changing FIFA’s powerful executive committee, was surprising. Just a few days earlier, he had said FIFA only needed small improvements, not major changes.\n\nThe U.S. investigation into FIFA became public last Wednesday. Swiss police arrested several FIFA officials, including two vice presidents, at a luxury hotel in Zurich. Later that day, U.S. authorities revealed charges against 14 people. These included FIFA officials and sports company executives. They were accused of bribery, fraud, and money laundering. The charges said FIFA officials took bribes from countries wanting to host the World Cup and from companies seeking media deals for soccer tournaments.\n\nBlatter first said he supported the U.S. investigation. But after his re-election, he criticized the timing of the arrests, which happened just two days before the FIFA presidential election. He also said U.S. authorities had no right to make arrests in another country.\n\nBlatter has not been charged with a crime, but investigators believe FIFA Secretary General Jérôme Valcke, Blatter’s top aide, was involved in transferring $10 million in 2008. This money was allegedly a bribe from South Africa to host the 2010 World Cup. Valcke denies knowing it was a bribe, and South African officials say they did not pay bribes.\n\nBlatter’s resignation marks the end of a long career. He joined FIFA in 1975 and became its president in 1998. Under his leadership, FIFA became very wealthy, largely through World Cup TV deals. However, rumors of corruption, bribes, and secret deals have surrounded FIFA for years, especially during elections and World Cup host selections.\n\nBlatter’s resignation raises questions about the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, which has faced widespread criticism. Many wonder if it will still be held there.\n\nBlatter’s decision to step down was welcomed by many. U.S. Soccer President Sunil Gulati called it a chance for positive change. Around the world, soccer players, officials, and fans celebrated the news. Brazilian soccer legend Romario called it \"the best news in ages\" and said it marked a new beginning for soccer. Argentine soccer star Diego Maradona said the resignation showed the truth was finally coming out.\n\nHowever, some people said Blatter’s resignation was just the first step in fixing soccer’s problems. Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany tweeted that soccer still needs fair elections and strong ethics.\n\nIn Germany, where the current World Cup champions are from, there was relief and celebration. Former German soccer player Hans Sarpei tweeted, \"I’ll go to my office now and dance with joy.\" German soccer legend Franz Beckenbauer said Blatter’s decision was the right move, though it came too late. The president of Germany’s soccer association, Wolfgang Niersbach, said it was a shame Blatter didn’t resign earlier to save himself and FIFA from further trouble."

        "gpt": "The world isn’t shrinking, but people are getting heavier, says a report published in *The Lancet* on Thursday.\n\nThe study found that more men, women, and children—whether in rich or poor countries—were overweight or obese in 2013 compared to 1980.  \n\nIn 1980, there were 857 million overweight or obese people worldwide. By 2013, that number had grown to 2.1 billion. This increase wasn’t just because the global population grew. The percentage of overweight or obese men went from 28.8% in 1980 to 36.9% in 2013. For women, it rose from 29.8% to 38%.  \n\nIn wealthier countries, 16.9% of boys and 16.2% of girls were overweight or obese in 1980. By 2013, those numbers had climbed to 23.8% for boys and 22.6% for girls. In poorer countries, the percentage of overweight or obese boys went from 8.1% to 12.9%, and for girls, it grew from 8.4% to 13.4%.  \n\nAcross the world, people were gaining weight at all ages, including as children and teens. The fastest weight gain happened between ages 20 and 40.  \n\nCarrying extra weight may seem harmless, but it can lead to serious health problems. Experts warn that being overweight or obese raises the risk of heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, strokes, and certain cancers. In 2010, a study estimated that 3.4 million deaths worldwide were caused by being overweight or obese.  \n\nFor this new study, researchers collected data from 183 countries. They looked at how many people were overweight (with a BMI of 25 or more) or obese (with a BMI of 30 or more) between 1980 and 2013. The study was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, but the foundation did not influence the results.  \n\nTonga had the highest percentage of obese adults. In six other countries, more than half of women were obese: Kuwait, Kiribati, Micronesia, Libya, Qatar, and Samoa.  \n\nThe U.S. stood out for its high obesity rates—31.6% of men and 33.9% of women were obese in 2013. About 13% of the world’s 671 million obese people lived in the U.S., more than any other country.  \n\nOver half of the world’s obese population lived in just 10 countries: the U.S., China, India, Russia, Brazil, Mexico, Egypt, Germany, Pakistan, and Indonesia. While China and India had low obesity rates (around 4–5%), their large populations meant they ranked second and third in total obese people.  \n\nOne of the most discouraging findings was that no country had reduced obesity levels in the past 33 years.  \n\nIn a commentary on the study, an expert named Klim McPherson asked what it would take for the world to stop weight gain and return to healthier levels seen 30 years ago. He noted that public health efforts have been successful in reducing smoking and heart disease deaths. But achieving similar success with obesity may take much longer.  \n\nMcPherson compared fighting obesity to fighting climate change. Experts know what needs to be done, but governments lack the will to make big changes. He wrote, “Where is the global effort to act for public health, even if it slows economic growth? Nowhere yet. But politicians can’t claim ignorance anymore.”"

        "gpt": "HORSE MOUNTAIN, Utah — At sunrise, Scott Richardson stands on a rocky hill near his campsite. He looks out at the dry valleys below, filled with bushes and small trees like junipers and pinyon pines.\n\n\"This is dinosaur country,\" he says, pointing to the valley. \"There are bones everywhere.\"\n\nHe cooks bacon on a small stove, the sound breaking the quiet morning. After breakfast, he drives his truck on a rough road deeper into the wilderness. He parks and heads toward a spot he wants to check out.\n\nScott, 58, is from Arizona. He wears a wide-brimmed hat and light-colored clothes to stay cool under the hot sun. He walks past quick-moving lizards and swats at annoying bugs as he travels along an old, overgrown road.\n\nNear the path, something catches his eye. A strange, oval-shaped rock sticks out of the ground. He looks closer and realizes it’s a 75-million-year-old dinosaur bone. It’s part of a hadrosaur’s spine, near its neck. Though it’s covered in dirt and looks like an ordinary rock, Scott knows it’s special. He’s seen many bones like this before.\n\n\"This is what I live for,\" he says, brushing dirt off the bone. He explains that more bones might be buried nearby. If he digs, he might find an entire dinosaur.\n\nScott is a dinosaur hunter. He searches for ancient bones from creatures that lived millions of years ago. For half the year, from spring to fall, he works for the Bureau of Land Management as a paleontology technician. He searches for bones in the wild, helps dig them up, and puts the pieces together in a lab.\n\nMost of the time, Scott hikes through bushes and dry land, watching for clues like unusual colors or shapes that might lead him to buried fossils.\n\n---\n\nScott grew up in Phoenix, Arizona. His parents were teachers. His dad taught him to love exploring the desert by looking for arrowheads together. Scott later trained as a geologist and worked in mining. But after his father died in an accident in 1986, Scott felt lost. He spent years hiking and wandering the western U.S.\n\nEventually, he volunteered at a natural history museum in Arizona. That job brought him to Utah, where he now works. For 12 years, he has explored southern Utah, searching for pieces of the past.\n\n\"Dinosaurs were giant creatures that ruled the world for millions of years,\" Scott says. In his lab in Kanab, Utah, he holds a huge dinosaur leg bone. \"Finding bones that haven’t been seen for 80 million years is amazing.\"\n\nThe Kaiparowits Plateau in southern Utah is full of dinosaur bones from the Cretaceous period, which lasted from 144 to 65 million years ago. Back then, this area was a warm, wet forest by the sea. It was part of a lost continent called Laramidia.\n\n\"It wasn’t an easy time to live,\" Scott explains. \"It was over 100 degrees, super humid, and full of predators, bugs, and parasites. Even the birds had teeth!\"\n\nThe Kaiparowits Plateau is remote and hard to explore. Scientists only started mapping it 50 years ago. In the last 10 years, they’ve found about 20 new kinds of dinosaurs here.\n\nThey’ve also discovered a 90-million-year-old shark, pieces of dinosaur skin, and crocodiles that could run on land. They’ve even found small, fast dinosaurs with sharp claws that hunted in packs.\n\nScott himself has found four new species of dinosaur. One was a Kosmoceratops, which had a complete head and spine. He also found an armored dinosaur, a relative of T. rex, and a new type of duck-billed dinosaur.\n\n\"Scott is very determined,\" says Mike Getty, a paleontologist from the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. \"He’s spent more time out there than almost anyone else. His success comes from experience and persistence.\"\n\nTo reach his camp each year, Scott drives his old truck on bumpy, dirt roads. The roads can become dangerous after rain, turning to mud or crumbling away. But rainstorms also help uncover new fossils by washing away dirt.\n\nScott loves the wilderness. The work, the quiet, and the beauty of the land make him happy.\n\n---\n\nScott remembers his first big dinosaur find like it was yesterday. In 2006, after a heavy rain, he spotted some bones sticking out of the ground near a ridgeline. He dropped his heavy backpack and started digging. Soon, he had dug so many holes that the area looked like a prairie dog town.\n\nExcited, he asked a paleontology team nearby to take a look. At first, they joked that it was nothing special. Then they told him the truth: It was a huge discovery—an intact skull from a new species related to the triceratops.\n\nThe dinosaur had 15 horns on its head, earning it the nickname \"the horniest dinosaur.\" It was later named Kosmoceratops richardsoni, after Scott. His friends started calling him \"Scottosaurus.\"\n\n\"That’s when I knew I’d made it,\" Scott says, smiling. There’s a photo of him with the skull, grinning like a proud parent.\n\nBut not every day is exciting. Some days, Scott finds nothing but plain rocks. To stay focused during long hikes, he clears his mind and concentrates only on the search. He wears a GPS tracker in case he gets lost or falls.\n\nScott spends most of his life outdoors. He sleeps in a trailer, a tent, or under the stars. Sometimes, he dreams of air conditioning on hot nights. One summer, after days of digging, he read the long book *War and Peace* while sitting in a camp chair. When he gets lonely, he visits town to talk to people.\n\nHe earns about $30,000 a year, drives a 25-year-old truck, and lives with his mom and cat in the off-season. But for Scott, the reward is being surrounded by nature—watching birds, lizards, or the aftermath of a summer storm.\n\n---\n\nAt another site, Scott works on a second hadrosaur bone. The sun rises higher, and the day gets hotter. The site is halfway dug out. A bone is wrapped in paper and cloth to keep it safe from the sun and animals. The biggest bones are removed by helicopter.\n\nScott looks at the layers of rock in the hillside. Digging in a 90-million-year-old graveyard makes him think about life and death.\n\n\"I want to die in a swamp and become a fossil,\" he jokes. \"Then, 80 million years from now, I want someone to find my skull and wonder, ‘Where does this piece belong?’\""

        "gpt": "MUMBAI, India — On a rainy Monday afternoon, the hallway of P.D. Hinduja Hospital was packed with patients. This private hospital helps about 350,000 people every year. The noise of talking filled the air as patients and nurses squeezed past each other to reach the office of Dr. Zarir Udwadia, a lung specialist. The walls were bright white, and the air smelled of disinfectant.\n\nAgainst one wall, an old man with a breathing tube lay groaning on a stretcher. Nearby, a father holding a stack of prescriptions tried to get a doctor’s attention for his sick daughter. Some families had traveled very far to be here. Many patients, like 19-year-old Nisha (not her real name), had tuberculosis (TB). Nisha, a college student from Madhya Pradesh, had been getting treatment for over a year. But mistakes in her diagnosis and prescriptions made her disease worse instead of curing it. “My doctors kept changing my medicines,” said Nisha, who wore jeans, a floral blouse, and black glasses. She spoke with hope, even though her illness had made her very thin.\n\nBy giving Nisha the wrong medicines, her doctors made the TB bacteria in her body stronger. Dr. Udwadia, the first to find extremely drug-resistant TB in India, says this problem is growing. India has too few labs to test for TB resistance, too many undertrained doctors, and crowded, dirty living conditions. This has made India the center of the world’s largest drug-resistant TB crisis. Each year, over 2 million people in India get TB, and someone dies from it every two minutes. About 62,000 people have a form of TB that doesn’t respond to at least four drugs, and about 15,000 have an even worse type called \"extensively drug-resistant\" TB, or XDR-TB, which resists almost all medicines.\n\nThis problem isn’t only India’s anymore. In June, U.S. health officials found that an Indian patient had carried XDR-TB to Chicago. The patient traveled to other states before being quarantined and treated in Maryland. XDR-TB is very hard to cure, with only 30% of patients surviving. Sometimes, parts of the lungs must be removed through surgery. While TB spreads more slowly than viruses like flu, the Chicago case shows it can easily travel to other countries.\n\nFor a long time, Indian health officials didn’t admit how serious the TB problem was, says Dr. Nerges Mistry, who leads the Foundation for Medical Research. They often denied it existed. Officials from India’s national TB program and Mumbai’s TB control office did not respond to requests for comments.\n\n---\n\n### TB and Its Challenges\n\nTB usually infects the lungs but can also affect other body parts like bones or the stomach. Unlike viruses like Ebola, which spread through direct contact with body fluids, TB spreads through the air when an infected person coughs. However, it’s harder to catch than the flu or chickenpox. Symptoms of lung TB include fever, night sweats, and a long-lasting cough.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends treating TB with a mix of antibiotics for six months. But if a patient doesn’t finish the treatment or the bacteria are already resistant to the drugs, the germs can survive, adapt, and become stronger. This makes it essential to kill all the bacteria during the first treatment.\n\nDrug-resistant TB happens when the bacteria no longer respond to one or more first-line drugs. Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) doesn’t respond to two main drugs, isoniazid and rifampicin. XDR-TB is even worse, resisting these drugs plus others.\n\nIn Nisha’s case, her doctors didn’t test her for drug resistance. For over a year, she took medicines that didn’t work. The side effects left her weak, with hearing loss and severe joint pain. Meanwhile, her infection became stronger.\n\nExperts like Dr. Udwadia are worried because India’s healthcare system is creating thousands of cases like Nisha’s. Although the government has started addressing the problem, progress is slow. Dr. Udwadia, a slim man with a sharp nose and neat black hair, has been pushing for change. His work has helped break the silence around drug-resistant TB in India.\n\nIndia once made progress against TB with a program called DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment, Short Course). This program, started in the 1990s, ensured patients completed their six-month treatment. Volunteers helped deliver free medicine to even the most remote areas. By 2010, the program was detecting 70% of new cases and successfully treating 88% of them.\n\nBut India still faces big challenges. Public health spending is very low, with less than one doctor per 1,000 people. There are also too few labs to test for drug resistance. As recently as 2008, less than 1% of high-risk patients were tested for resistance. Many private doctors used unreliable blood tests, leading to overuse of antibiotics, which worsens resistance.\n\n---\n\n### A Wake-Up Call\n\nIn 2011, Dr. Udwadia reported a new, more dangerous form of TB resistant to all available drugs. This “totally drug-resistant TB” alarmed the public and media. Bollywood star Amir Khan even discussed it on his talk show. The government responded by increasing the TB program’s budget, hiring more staff, and switching to better testing machines called GeneXpert. These machines quickly detect drug resistance, helping doctors choose the right treatments.\n\nHowever, there are still not enough machines. Mumbai has 18, but the whole country has only 120. These machines only test for resistance to one drug, rifampicin. If a patient is resistant, they are put on a standard treatment for MDR-TB. But this one-size-fits-all approach doesn’t work for everyone. In Mumbai, Dr. Udwadia’s research shows it only cures about one-third of resistant patients. The rest become even more resistant.\n\nIndia doesn’t yet know the full scale of its resistance problem. There aren’t enough labs to collect data, but experts believe XDR-TB is growing, especially in cities like Mumbai. With so many Indians traveling abroad, resistant TB could spread to other countries.\n\n---\n\n### Hope Amid Challenges\n\nDespite the difficulties, there is hope. Dr. Udwadia has found some success treating XDR-TB with a mix of drugs, including new ones like bedaquiline. This drug offers a chance of survival, but it’s toxic and not yet fully approved in India. Patients with resistant TB often endure long, painful treatments with severe side effects.\n\nIn Dr. Udwadia’s office, a woman named Vanita (not her real name) had been fighting XDR-TB for years. After months of preparing her body for stronger drugs, she was finally approved for bedaquiline. Her eyes filled with tears of relief. Dr. Udwadia remains hopeful, saying, “Total doesn’t mean totally doomed.”"

One day, a bull knocked a gate into her, causing serious injuries. She needed 60 stitches and almost lost her leg.\n\nThen Sweet Baby Jo arrived. The dog is part of PHARM Dog, a program that helps farmers with disabilities keep working. PHARM stands for \"Pets Helping Agriculture in Rural Missouri.\" It’s one of a kind, training dogs to assist farmers like Owen, who owns a farm with her husband, Rick.\n\n\"Now I can help Rick,\" Owen says. \"I can herd the cows while he gets hay. I feel useful again.\"\n\nAnother farmer, Jim Harig, has trouble walking due to nerve damage. His dog, Dixon, helps him check on his animals. Dixon can carry buckets, fetch tools, and even open gates. \"If I had to sell my animals, I’d lose my will to live,\" Harig says.\n\nPHARM Dog started in 2012, founded by Jackie Allenbrand from Gentry County, Missouri. She created the program to help farmers with disabilities stay on their farms. \"Farmers are stubborn,\" Allenbrand says. \"It’s their life, and they don’t want to give it up.\"\n\nOne farmer, Troy Balderston, uses a wheelchair after a car accident left him paralyzed. His dog, Duke, helps him move cattle. \"The cows don’t listen to me because I’m low to the ground,\" Balderston says. \"But they listen to him.\"\n\nTraining the dogs takes time and effort. Bobby Miller, a trainer, has been helping since the program began. He even uses a wheelchair during training so the dogs get used to it. \"Border collies are easy,\" Miller says. \"They love to work. Sometimes it’s the farmers who need training!\"\n\nNot everything goes smoothly. One farmer’s dog was kicked by a cow and died. Another was hit by a bus. But the farmers are grateful for the help. Harig, who struggles to walk and use his arms, says Dixon acts like a cane for him. \"All he cares about is helping me,\" Harig says.\n\nAllenbrand hopes to expand PHARM Dog to help more farmers in more states. The program relies on donations and volunteers. \"If I can help farmers stay on their land, that’s what I want to do,\" she says.\n\nFor Owen, Sweet Baby Jo has made all the difference. Every morning, the dog helps her manage the cows. \"I couldn’t do this without her,\" Owen says.\n\nPHARM Dog is more than just a program—it’s a lifeline for farmers who refuse to give up the work they love."

        "gpt": "DALLAS, Texas — If you want to know the real Ahmed Mohamed — not the boy accused of making a fake bomb or the sudden celebrity, but the curious kid with a backpack full of inventions and endless questions — ask his teachers.\n\nAt Sam Houston Middle School, Ahmed learned electronics and English. He once made a remote control to prank the classroom projector and proudly recited his First Amendment rights in the principal's office. But this was also where Ahmed faced weeks of suspensions and felt targeted by a school administrator. Before leaving for high school, Ahmed's complaints about anti-Muslim bullying led the school district to investigate.\n\nTo know Ahmed before the fame, you could ask Ralph Kubiak, his seventh-grade history teacher. Kubiak, now retired, called Ahmed \"a weird little kid\" but said he saw himself in the boy’s love of learning. \"He could grow up to be a CEO or the head of a gang,\" Kubiak joked.\n\nKubiak wasn’t a typical teacher. He had a thick beard, played rock music in class, and shared stories about the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War. His goal was to teach kids, many of whom were poor, to question authority and understand their rights. Ahmed was eager to learn.\n\nAhmed arrived at Sam Houston in sixth grade, small for his age, wearing glasses, and speaking little English. By seventh grade, he could discuss similarities between Islam, Christianity, and Judaism in Kubiak’s classroom. He was confident in his faith and willing to talk about tough topics like terrorism. Kubiak recalled Ahmed agreeing that groups like ISIS twisted Muslim teachings to mislead people.\n\nBut Ahmed wasn’t always serious. After school, he and friends would run into each other at full speed on the playground, laughing and getting back up to do it again. Still, Ahmed’s intelligence stood out in class, in robotics club, and in his homemade gadgets. He often brought his inventions to school, like a remote control for the projector or a homemade battery charger for a dead phone. Some of these creations looked messy, with wires and circuits, but they didn’t cause problems at Sam Houston.\n\nAhmed did find trouble in other ways. He quickly learned English and liked to talk — a lot. Teachers said he sometimes annoyed them with his nonstop chatter. Kubiak remembered teasing Ahmed for trying to get out of detention by quoting the First Amendment. \"What did the principal do?\" Kubiak asked. Ahmed replied, \"She gave me Saturday detention.\"\n\nAhmed’s discipline record is private, but he admitted being suspended for weeks in sixth grade. A family friend, Anthony Bond, said one suspension happened after Ahmed and a cousin blew soap bubbles in the bathroom. \"Kids are kids,\" Bond said. In seventh grade, Ahmed was punished again. Kubiak sent his classwork to a special center until Ahmed finished his punishment, but the boy still earned an A in history.\n\nBy eighth grade, Ahmed started complaining about bullying, not just from students but also from staff. Bond wrote to the school superintendent, saying Ahmed had been suspended after defending himself in a fight where another boy choked him. Ahmed also said kids called him names like \"Bacon Boy\" and \"ISIS Boy.\" Bond accused the school of unfairly targeting Ahmed because he was Muslim. After the letter, the principal overturned Ahmed’s suspension.\n\nThough Kubiak wasn’t Ahmed’s teacher anymore, they still talked in the hallways. Ahmed told Kubiak he felt bullied and often seemed upset. Kubiak believed Ahmed thought he was being treated unfairly and said, \"This kid was being pushed.\"\n\nKubiak himself felt out of place at Sam Houston. He disagreed with how quickly the school punished students and refused to follow a new system he felt was unfair. Eventually, he was reassigned to teach sixth grade and decided to retire. \"They didn’t force me out,\" he said, \"but I was happy to leave.\"\n\nOn Ahmed’s last day at Sam Houston, he didn’t get to say goodbye to Kubiak. The staff rushed students out, and Ahmed later tried to email his teacher, but the account was already shut down.\n\nA few months later, Ahmed became famous after being arrested at his new high school for bringing a homemade clock to class. Some of his middle school teachers were shocked. At Sam Houston, Ahmed had brought in more complicated gadgets all the time without trouble.\n\nAhmed smiled when he heard Kubiak had asked about him. They talked on the phone about Ahmed’s sudden fame — his TV appearances and plans to visit Google and the United Nations. But Kubiak worried about how fame might affect Ahmed. He often warned his students, \"Adults have an agenda. Don’t let them use you.\"\n\nThe next time Kubiak tried to call Ahmed, he had to leave a voicemail. He called again but didn’t hear back. Kubiak now wonders if the adults have taken over Ahmed’s life."

        "gpt": "COLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France — The chaos of D-Day in 1944, with exploding shells, seasick soldiers, and bloody waters, is long gone. On Friday, Normandy was filled with sunlight and peace as people marked 70 years since the D-Day invasion, a key moment in World War II.\n\nOnly a few of the 150,000 Allied soldiers who landed on the beaches or parachuted into Normandy are still alive. Some of these veterans stood proudly with President Barack Obama, French President Francois Hollande, and other leaders to honor the largest sea invasion in history.\n\nThe veterans, who once freed France from Nazi control, saluted with hands that now tremble. Some stood with difficulty as thousands of people clapped for them.\n\n\"Thank you for coming in the summer of 1944. Thank you for being here on June 6, 2014,\" Hollande said to the veterans at Sword Beach, one of the five beaches stormed by the Allies. He promised that France's gratitude would last forever.\n\nEarlier, Hollande honored U.S. soldiers buried at the Normandy American Cemetery. He declared, \"Long live America! Long live France! And long live the memory of those who died here for our freedom.\"\n\nAt Omaha Beach, which he called \"democracy's beachhead,\" Obama said that America's promise of liberty and equality is written in blood on these shores and will last forever.\n\nNineteen world leaders, over 1,000 veterans, and many others gathered to remember the soldiers and civilians who died in the fierce battles that helped bring peace to Europe.\n\nAt 6:30 a.m., the time Allied troops first landed on June 6, 1944, a U.S. military band played taps. Veterans of the 29th Infantry Division and current soldiers stood at attention. They shouted, \"Twenty-nine, let's go!\" and took a sip of Calvados, Normandy's apple brandy. Residents and visitors cheered and formed a human chain on the beach.\n\nThe sun shone brightly, lighting up a land where, years ago, paratroopers' bodies hung from trees and medics pulled wounded soldiers from bloody waves.\n\nHowever, peace in Europe still faces challenges, like the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Hollande used the event to bring together Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine's president-elect Petro Poroshenko.\n\n\"Because France has suffered from war, it feels a duty to protect peace everywhere,\" Hollande said. He hosted world leaders at a historic chateau and a port town that played a key role in D-Day.\n\nThe leaders and veterans watched a performance on the beach that showed the horrors of war and Europe's recovery. It included wartime film clips, music, and a display of fighter planes releasing red, white, and blue smoke.\n\nThe D-Day invasion, called Operation Overlord, involved landings on five beaches: Gold, Juno, Omaha, Sword, and Utah. It was a turning point in the war, breaking through Hitler's defenses in the west while Soviet troops advanced in the east. On the first day, at least 4,400 Allied soldiers died. Thousands more died in the three-month-long Battle of Normandy before the Allies could free Paris from Nazi control.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel joined Friday's ceremonies, along with a few German veterans, to show the unity that the Allied victory eventually brought to Europe. Events honoring D-Day happened across Normandy and around the world.\n\nAt the Cathedral of Bayeux, Prince Charles attended a ceremony that left British veteran Richard England emotional. \"It brought back memories of all the boys I lost, my brother-in-law who died near the end, and the brave men who fought with me but are gone now,\" said England, who served in the 8th Durham Infantry Battalion.\n\nThousands of people, including veterans and families, gathered at the Normandy American Cemetery, where 9,387 white tombstones overlook Omaha Beach. Small U.S. and French flags were placed at each grave.\n\nThe ceremonies also remembered the 20,000 French civilians killed during Allied bombings, especially in Normandy. Hollande honored them in Caen, a city heavily bombed during the invasion. France has struggled to fully acknowledge the impact of these bombings on its people.\n\nFriday's events also recognized soldiers fighting in today’s wars. Jeffrey McIllwain, a professor, brought 12 students to Normandy to learn about D-Day. He wants them to pass on the memory to future generations. \"I make them promise to bring their grandchildren,\" he said.\n\nChildren joined world leaders during the main ceremony, symbolizing the passing of history to the next generation.\n\nVeteran Jack Schlegel, 91, from Albany, New York, attended the 40th, 50th, 60th, and now 70th anniversaries of D-Day. \"The president of the Veterans of Foreign Wars wants me at the 75th, but I don’t know,\" said Schlegel, who was a paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne Division. \"My mind is still sharp, but I’m not sure about my body.\""

        "gpt": "BEIJING — In China, many women face cigarette smoke both at work and at home. Offices are often filled with smoke from male colleagues, and at home, husbands or family members often smoke near them.\n\nChina is called the \"Smoking Dragon\" because so many people smoke. But most smokers are men. In 2010, 288 million men smoked regularly compared to only 13 million women.\n\nNow, women are fighting back. Last year, China's government proposed stricter rules to ban indoor smoking and limit tobacco ads. This was a big win for people working to stop smoking in China, including many women who have been fighting this battle for years.\n\n\"This is a big step,\" said Yang Gonghuan, a health expert who has studied smoking in China since the 1980s. She explained that changing smoking laws is very hard and takes a long time.\n\nSmoking is a huge health problem in China. Every year, 1 million people die from lung cancer and other smoking-related illnesses.\n\nSome famous men, like basketball star Yao Ming, have joined the anti-smoking movement. But women are leading the effort. Li Bin, China's health commissioner, has pushed for a national indoor smoking ban. She works with other women in the government to make this happen.\n\nYang Gonghuan has done important research on smoking's effects. Other top women in the movement include Wu Yiqun, who started a health research group, and Xu Guihua, who works for the Chinese Association on Tobacco Control. Angela Pratt, from the World Health Organization, said these women have worked hard to make smoking a big issue in China.\n\nThe fight is far from over. More than half of Chinese men still smoke, and about 700 million people are exposed to secondhand smoke. This smoke kills around 100,000 people every year.\n\nMany women are involved in the movement because secondhand smoke affects them and their children. For years, smoking was common for both men and women in China. But in the early 1900s, society started to look down on women who smoked. Since then, most women have stopped smoking, but men have continued.\n\nChina is the world's largest tobacco user and producer. The government controls almost all cigarette sales through the China National Tobacco Corp. This creates a problem because while one part of the government wants to reduce smoking, another part earns money from it. In 2012, tobacco brought in $120 billion, about 6% of government revenue.\n\nYang said this is why change is slow. The tobacco industry is very powerful. She became interested in smoking-related diseases in the 1980s while studying medicine. She later worked with the World Health Organization and helped China sign a global anti-smoking treaty in 2005. But even after the treaty, smoking stayed common, especially in rural areas.\n\nRecently, attitudes are changing. Top leaders in China avoid smoking in public, and in 2013, officials were banned from smoking or giving cigarettes as gifts. Some cities have also created their own smoking bans.\n\nThe new rules proposed last year would ban indoor smoking, limit tobacco ads, and require larger health warnings on cigarette packs. Businesses would have to enforce the rules or face fines. Xu Guihua said this would save lives but would need a cultural shift. People in China are used to smoking anywhere they want, so change will take time.\n\nStill, leaders like President Xi Jinping support the changes. His wife, Peng Liyuan, has been active in anti-smoking campaigns. But the tobacco industry remains strong and has powerful friends in the government. Li Keming, the brother of China's premier, helps run the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration, which opposes stricter smoking rules.\n\nThe future of these rules will be decided soon. If the government makes them a top priority, they could become law this year. If not, the tobacco industry may delay or stop them.\n\nYang is hopeful. She said rising healthcare costs from smoking-related diseases are forcing the government to act. In 2010, these costs were $253 billion, far more than the money earned from tobacco sales.\n\n\"Years ago, the government focused only on economic growth,\" Yang said. \"Now, they are starting to see the burden of smoking-related diseases.\""

        "gpt": "CASPER, Wyo. — Wyoming is booming thanks to oil. Jobs in oil and natural gas are everywhere, and unemployment is low at 4.6%, much better than the national rate of 7.4%. Workers earn good money, and the oil industry has brought quick success to many.\n\nBut some people worry about the state depending too much on oil. Oil prices can drop suddenly, and Wyoming could face big problems if that happens. Critics say many young people are skipping college or even dropping out of high school to work in oil fields, without a backup plan if the jobs disappear.\n\nOne example is Tyrel Wellmaker. He joined the oil industry after high school and earned a six-figure salary. He bought a house and a $50,000 truck. But the work was dangerous, and after seeing coworkers die and enduring tough conditions, he quit. Without savings, he went bankrupt, lost his house and truck, and moved back in with his dad. Now 31, he regrets not going to college earlier.\n\nIn Wyoming, oil jobs pay more than many college-degree jobs. Across the U.S., people with a bachelor's degree usually earn more than those with only a high school diploma. But in Wyoming, some workers without degrees make as much or more than college graduates, thanks to oil.\n\nWyoming relies heavily on fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas, which provide 70% of the state’s income. Some experts say the state should take advantage of the current boom while it lasts. Mark Perry, an energy expert, says young people should grab the chance to make money now and go back to school later if needed.\n\nStill, others argue Wyoming needs to prepare for the future. They say the state should create more jobs outside the energy industry. Sissy Goodwin, a teacher at Casper College, says politicians aren't doing enough to bring in new types of jobs. Many workers return to school after injuries or layoffs, realizing their oil jobs weren’t permanent.\n\nThe state has tried to attract new industries, like tech, but jobs for college graduates are still scarce. Jim Rose, a college official, says Wyoming doesn’t have enough opportunities for skilled workers, so training students for other industries often pushes them to leave the state.\n\nState Senator Jim Anderson says oil workers need to save their money and plan for the future. He believes financial education is key, so workers can save for schooling later if needed.\n\nOil executives, however, see Wyoming’s resources as a blessing. They say ups and downs in the oil industry are normal, and workers need to be ready for changes. Cary Brus, an oil company leader, says he lost his job during an oil bust in the 1980s but went back to school and moved on.\n\nOther workers are also moving on. Jonathan Odlin, a former Marine, left the oil fields after a dangerous accident killed a friend. Now he’s studying power plant technology at Casper College to build a safer, stable career.\n\nWellmaker is also back in school, studying renewable energy. He hopes to help create green communities powered by wind and solar. Though he wishes he had finished school earlier, he’s focused on the future. \"Oil won’t last forever,\" he says. \"What will people do when the big paychecks stop?\""

        "gpt": "### PRO: U.S. troops are great at helping in emergencies\n\nWASHINGTON — President Barack Obama sent U.S. military units to West Africa to help fight the Ebola outbreak. This was a good idea, but he explained it the wrong way.\n\nObama called it a \"national security\" mission, but that's not accurate. Not every problem should be called a security issue. Real national security threats come from people or groups, like other countries or terrorists, who could harm the U.S. with violence. Problems like diseases or natural disasters are serious, but they aren't the same as security threats.\n\nHelping with Ebola in West Africa is a humanitarian mission, which means it’s about helping people in need. America has done this before. For example, after the 2004 tsunami in Asia, the U.S. gave more help than most other countries. The U.S. military is very good at these kinds of missions. Soldiers often help during disasters, like delivering supplies after hurricanes or floods. These tasks aren’t the military’s main job, but they are important and done when needed.\n\nSending U.S. troops to West Africa to stop Ebola makes sense. The military can quickly provide support, equipment, and skills to help local groups fight the disease. It also helps protect Americans because stopping Ebola at its source reduces the chance of it spreading here. Travel bans and visa restrictions are less effective solutions.\n\nThis mission is also possible and reasonable. There are risks, as Ebola is dangerous, but U.S. troops are trained to follow safety rules and handle tough situations. They are brave and understand the risks of their job.\n\nHowever, Obama should have explained this as a humanitarian mission, not a national security one. Mislabeling missions can confuse people about what the military should focus on. It’s also important to make sure the mission is well-planned and has enough resources to succeed.\n\n### CON: Sending U.S. troops to fight Ebola is unfair\n\nWASHINGTON — President Barack Obama is using U.S. soldiers to fight Ebola to show he cares, but this is not the right job for the military.\n\nThe U.S. military is already very busy. The Army is being reduced in size, but now Obama wants to send 4,000 troops to West Africa. At the same time, the U.S. is also fighting the extremist group Islamic State, which might need more soldiers later. This puts too much pressure on our military.\n\nThere are also big risks in West Africa. Ebola causes fear, and fear can lead to violence. Soldiers may have to step in to keep order. This could mean they face dangerous situations, like violent riots. In one case, Liberian soldiers had to choose between protecting themselves or stopping the spread of Ebola. U.S. troops could face the same hard choices.\n\nAnother problem is that the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), which should lead the fight against Ebola, is not fully prepared. Even trained health workers in the U.S. have caught Ebola. If the CDC isn’t ready, how can soldiers, who aren’t medical experts, do the job safely?\n\nSending troops could also cause political problems. The countries affected by Ebola, like Liberia and Sierra Leone, are unstable. People there might think the U.S. military is taking sides in their internal conflicts. This could make things worse, like what happened in Somalia in 1993.\n\nObama has also refused to use travel bans, which could help protect Americans. Instead, he is putting soldiers in danger to fix the problem far away. This is unfair and risky. Soldiers should not have to pay the price for a poorly planned mission."

Susan Ford had her dates judged. Many presidential children, especially girls and young women, have been targets of harsh comments, even since Lincoln’s time.\n\nRecently, Sasha and Malia Obama were criticized by a Republican aide, sparking outrage, especially among African-Americans. The Obama family is seen as a symbol of Black success, making these comments especially hurtful.\n\nJames Peterson, a professor at Lehigh University, explained, \"The Obama family represents something powerful for many Black households.\" \n\nElizabeth Lauten, a Republican staffer, resigned after her Facebook post criticized the Obama daughters for how they acted and dressed during a Thanksgiving event. She later apologized, saying she judged them unfairly, but the damage was already done.\n\nMark Anthony Neal, a professor at Duke University, said the Obama daughters are seen as role models, and Lauten’s comments upset many people, both Black and non-Black.\n\nCriticizing presidential children, especially young ones, is generally seen as wrong, but it’s not new. In 1966, Luci Johnson, President Lyndon Johnson’s daughter, said strangers judged her school grades. Susan Ford was criticized for wearing jeans in the White House and for her dates. Patti Davis, Ronald Reagan’s daughter, recalled being judged for her outfit at an event with Queen Elizabeth II. She wrote to Sasha and Malia, saying, \"As first daughters, you can’t win. People will always criticize you.\"\n\nAmy Carter and Chelsea Clinton faced harsh comments as teens. Rush Limbaugh once called Carter the \"ugliest presidential daughter.\" He later apologized but compared 13-year-old Chelsea to a dog on his TV show. Chelsea said she learned to ignore such attacks, calling them a reflection of the critics, not herself.\n\nEven after leaving the White House, Chelsea was criticized during her mother Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign. A TV anchor suggested she was being used unfairly, leading to the anchor’s suspension.\n\nGeorge W. Bush’s twin daughters, Jenna and Barbara, were criticized for underage drinking and playful behavior in front of photographers.\n\nHistorian Doug Wead, who wrote about presidential families, said this kind of criticism has a long history. Robert Todd Lincoln was judged for avoiding military service, and Franklin Roosevelt’s children were accused of getting special treatment.\n\nIn the 1830s, newspapers attacked President William Henry Harrison’s children, accusing one son of fraud. Even Theodore Roosevelt’s daughter, Alice, caused a stir. Her smoking and driving without a chaperone were seen as shocking at the time.\n\nRoosevelt once joked, \"I can run the country or be a father to Alice, but I can’t do both.\"\n\nWead explained that Lauten’s comments were controversial because most Americans see the Obamas as good parents, regardless of political views."

But 13-year-old Grayson Davey spent his week looking for workers for his business.\n\nGrayson owns Alaska Paracord Designs, a company he started when he was 11. In just three years, he has made over $40,000 in sales. He creates paracord bracelets and keychains at home but now wants to hire others to help him make more products. These bracelets and keychains are made from strong nylon cord and include tools that could save lives.\n\nOne of his best-selling items is the fire-starter bracelet. It looks like a regular woven bracelet, but it can be unraveled to provide 17 feet of strong cord. The bracelet also has a whistle clasp, fire-starting tools, and waxed twine that can easily catch fire. People can use it to build a shelter, start a fire, or signal for help in an emergency.\n\n\"If something goes wrong on an adventure, what you have with you is your survival kit,\" Grayson explained.\n\nSince 2013, Grayson has sold over 1,000 fire-starter bracelets and fire bugs. The fire bug is a smaller version that attaches to a keychain and includes a mirror and small knife. The bracelets sell for $35, and the fire bugs cost $25.\n\nOver spring break, Grayson found two people who might work for him, but he needs at least three more. Even though he’s still in middle school, he has already invested $10,000 of his profits in the stock market and put the rest back into his growing business.\n\n\"I want to make the company as big as I can,\" Grayson said. \"I hope it pays for college, and maybe it could even be my career.\"\n\nGrayson is part of a group called the Young Entrepreneurs' Academy. This group helps teens learn from experienced businesspeople and get money to start their own businesses. Many young people today want to be their own boss instead of working for someone else.\n\nGrayson’s idea came from a scary story. A family friend and his daughter got stranded on an island for three days after their boat flipped over. They couldn’t build a fire or shelter because they lost all their supplies. Grayson thought a bracelet with survival tools could have helped them.\n\nNow, Grayson’s products are sold online and in local stores. One store manager, Stewart Valladolid, was impressed when Grayson first showed him the bracelet. \"I was amazed by the detail and survival features,\" he said. The store has been selling the bracelets ever since, and many employees wear them too.\n\nTo grow his business, Grayson wants to hire people who can work from home. They would learn how to weave the bracelets and could earn $15 to $20 per hour, working part-time.\n\nFor Grayson, starting and running his business has been about more than just making money. It has taught him important life lessons. \"Schools don’t teach enough about entrepreneurship,\" said his mom, Lori Davey.\n\nGrayson encourages others to follow their dreams. \"If you have an idea for a business, explore ways to start it and grow it,\" he said. \"But remember, it’s not always easy. You have to work hard.\""

They will record the conversation and upload it to the Library of Congress.\n\nStoryCorps, a group that collects stories, is asking high school history teachers to help students use their free smartphone app to record these interviews. The recordings will be saved in a public archive at the American Folklife Center.\n\nThis project, called \"The Great Thanksgiving Listen,\" is meant to last for generations, said StoryCorps founder Dave Isay.\n\n\"When students send their recordings to the library, they know that their great-great-great-grandkids will be able to listen to the conversation someday and learn about their family history,\" Isay said.\n\nHe hopes the project will become a yearly tradition that helps families connect and saves the stories and wisdom of older generations using modern technology.\n\nStudents might hear memories from as far back as the 1920s. But Isay says the most important part is not the stories themselves—it’s the connection between the two people talking.\n\n\"The goal is for the two people to feel closer and for the person being interviewed to feel heard,\" he said. \"It’s not just about the stories—it’s about the experience of recording them together.\"\n\nBrandon Clarke, who works at the Berkeley Carroll School in Brooklyn, New York, is excited about the project. StoryCorps worked with some of his teachers to create a guide for the Thanksgiving assignment.\n\nBefore the holiday, students at the school may practice interviewing in class, Clarke said.\n\n\"They’ll learn how to ask good questions, how to do an interview, and how to follow up on interesting answers.\"\n\nBut Isay said interviewing is not difficult. From the 60,000 conversations StoryCorps has collected since 2003, he has learned that people are naturally good at it.\n\n\"You just need to focus, be in the moment, and find a quiet place,\" he said. \"People understand how important this is and take it seriously.\"\n\nEvery Friday, about 13 million people hear clips of StoryCorps interviews on National Public Radio's \"Morning Edition.\" StoryCorps also shares stories through videos, podcasts, and its website. Most of these stories come from its recording booths in cities like New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and Atlanta, or from its mobile recording booth.\n\nSince the StoryCorps app was launched in March, 10,000 interviews have been uploaded. The app was created with a $1 million TED prize and a $600,000 grant.\n\nIsay said the Thanksgiving project supports the idea, promoted by historian Studs Terkel, that history isn’t just about famous people—it’s about regular people, too.\n\nClarke agrees.\n\n\"This shows that oral history is real history,\" Clarke said. \"History doesn’t have to come from books.

The protests turned deadly, with two people losing their lives.\n\nIn Ribeirao Preto, a city 185 miles from Sao Paulo, an 18-year-old man died, and three others were hurt when a car hit them while trying to avoid a protest barricade. Another person died from a heart attack after a tear gas canister exploded near her.\n\nBrazil’s president, Dilma Rousseff, canceled a trip to Japan and held an emergency meeting on Friday. She spoke on TV and radio, asking people to stay calm and not risk what the country has achieved. She promised to do more for public services, including using all oil money for education, sending doctors to rural areas, improving public transport, and talking with peaceful protest leaders.\n\nThe protests started peacefully but turned violent in some cities. Protesters threw stones, and police used rubber bullets and tear gas. Hundreds were injured. These are the largest protests Brazil has seen in 20 years.\n\nIn Rio de Janeiro, people from poor neighborhoods joined the protests, chanting, \"I'll give up the World Cup. I want money for health and education.\" The protests began over rising bus and train fares but grew to include anger over corruption and the high cost of hosting sports events like the Confederations Cup, 2014 World Cup, and 2016 Olympics.\n\nMany Brazilians are upset about the billions spent on stadiums while public services like schools and hospitals are poor. Edgar Reinoso, 61, said, \"For Brazilians to come to the streets like this, it means a lot is wrong — mainly corruption.\"\n\nBrazil’s economy has grown in recent years, and many people have moved into the middle class.

Even after the government canceled the bus fare hike, the protests grew. \"Corruption is the main issue,\" said historian Francisco Carlos Teixeira.\n\nIn other cities, like Campinas and Salvador, there were also violent clashes.

This project will bring over 500 jobs to the area.\n\nIn the past, the Carolinas were a big part of the U.S. textile industry. But starting in the late 1990s, many jobs were lost. Cheaper materials and labor in countries like China, Brazil, and Vietnam caused factories in the Carolinas to shut down.\n\nNow, things have changed. Chinese companies are opening factories in the U.S. They are drawn by lower costs for energy, cotton, and land. Labor costs in China have also gone up, making the U.S. more attractive.\n\nWally Wang, a manager at Keer America, thinks more Chinese companies will follow Keer’s example and move to the U.S.\n\nThis is good news for Lancaster County, where many people still feel the loss of textile jobs. Carolyn Summers, who worked at Springs Industries for 42 years, lost her job in 2005. Her daughter lost hers two years later. \"We were flooded with cheaper textiles from other countries,\" Summers said.\n\nAt its peak, Springs Mills in Lancaster employed nearly 20,000 people. By 2007, the last textile factory in South Carolina closed. From 1995 to 2007, Lancaster County lost 11,000 textile jobs, and the larger region lost about 26,000.\n\nSummers said, \"We didn’t think textile jobs would ever come back.\"\n\n### $218 Million Project\n\nIn August, workers were finishing Keer’s 230,000-square-foot factory in Lancaster. The factory will be ready by December. By spring, at least 140 people will start working there, making yarn on 32 production lines.\n\nChina has been a leader in the global textile market for 20 years. But rising costs in China have pushed companies like Keer to move some operations to the U.S. Keer’s investment in Lancaster is worth $218 million.\n\nOnce the first factory is running, Keer will build a second one nearby. Construction will take less than 18 months. After that, two more factories are planned. In total, Keer will have over 1 million square feet of space and create 500 jobs.\n\nA South Carolina program called SC Ready is helping Keer find and train workers. Many applicants are former textile workers who want to return to the industry.\n\nKeer hopes to inspire other Chinese companies to follow its lead. Wang described this as being “the first to eat the crab,” meaning others will follow once they see it’s possible.\n\n### Cotton Brings Mills Back\n\nCotton brought textile mills to the Carolinas nearly 200 years ago, and it’s bringing them back now.\n\nKeer’s Wally Wang said cotton prices are a big challenge in China. Cotton in the U.S. is much cheaper. Chinese cotton costs about $2,889 per ton, while U.S. cotton costs about $2,006 per ton.\n\nKeer’s Lancaster factory will use 30,000 tons of cotton every year to make 28,000 tons of yarn.\n\nThe cost of making goods in China has risen in recent years. Keer, which has used American cotton for years, decided to move closer to its supply.\n\nWang listed South Carolina’s benefits: a manufacturing-friendly state, workers used to long hours, low union rates, helpful government policies, cheap and reliable electricity, and a variety of industries in the area. \"Except for labor, everything else is cheaper in the U.S.,\" Wang said.\n\nKeer’s factory will use local Carolina cotton. Finished yarn will then be shipped from Charleston back to China, where it will be made into clothes.\n\n### Recruiting Keer\n\nSouth Carolina and North Carolina worked hard to attract Keer. John Ling, a recruiter for South Carolina, met Keer’s CEO in 2012. South Carolina offered Keer a $4 million grant, and Lancaster County provided $7.7 million in tax support.\n\nKeith Tunnell, head of Lancaster’s Economic Development group, said they are also working on other projects in Asia. Lancaster County is branding itself as the \"U.S. textile technology corridor.\"\n\n### China Still Leads in Textiles\n\nChina still has an edge in making clothes, which requires a lot of labor. But making yarn and fabrics is more automated, giving the U.S. an advantage with lower energy costs.\n\nChinese companies have started investing more in the U.S. since 2010, thanks to new government policies. South Carolina now sees 20 to 25 Chinese companies visiting each year to explore opportunities.\n\nKeer’s move to South Carolina is just the start, said Doug Woodward, an economics professor. \"It’s like small steps, but it’s just the beginning,\" he said.\n\nWang, who works in Charlotte, said Chinese investment in the U.S. used to be like \"small drops of water.\" Now, it’s starting to flow like a stream."

        "gpt": "A monkey named Naruto took selfies that became famous. Animal-rights group PETA says Naruto, not the photographer who set up the camera, should own the rights to the photos. They filed a lawsuit last Tuesday in a San Francisco court.\n\nPETA wants to manage any money made from the photos to help Naruto and other monkeys living in a reserve on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. Naruto is a 6-year-old crested macaque.\n\nThe photos were taken in 2011 by David Slater, a British nature photographer, during a trip to Sulawesi. Slater published the photos in a book called *Wildlife Personalities*. However, the photos are also shared on websites like Wikipedia, which says no one owns the rights because they were taken by an animal, not a person.\n\nSlater is upset about the lawsuit. He says he supports animal rights but believes he should own the photos. He explained that he set up the tripod and camera, and the monkey only pressed the button.\n\nIn 2022, the U.S. Copyright Office said only humans can own copyrights. It said works by animals, like photos taken by monkeys or paintings by elephants, do not qualify. But PETA’s lawyer, Jeffrey Kerr, disagrees. He says the U.S. Copyright Act does not say copyrights are only for humans. Kerr argues the law gives rights to whoever creates the work, regardless of species.\n\nPETA’s lawsuit claims Naruto acted on his own when he took the selfies. They used Slater’s own writings as evidence, which describe how the monkey handled the camera.\n\nSlater has argued that the photos are his creation since he set up the equipment and planned the shots. He said he hopes to pass the rights to his daughter so she can benefit from his work in the future.\n\nPETA has filed other unusual lawsuits before. In 2011, they sued SeaWorld, saying it treated killer whales like slaves. A judge dismissed the case, saying the law only applies to humans.\n\nSome experts think PETA’s case is interesting but difficult to win. A law professor, David Favre, called it a \"cutting-edge legal question.\" Another lawyer, Cheryl Dancey Balough, said the case might depend on whether Slater’s setup counts as enough creativity to claim copyright.\n\nHarvard law professor Laurence Tribe, who supports animal rights, is critical of the lawsuit. He thinks it distracts from more serious animal issues, like hunting and exploitation."

        "gpt": "WASHINGTON — In May 1995, geophysicist H. Jay Melosh attended a meeting with U.S. and ex-Soviet nuclear weapons experts. He was surprised to see how eager they were to work together to stop a rare but serious danger: asteroids heading toward Earth.  \n\nAt the meeting, Edward Teller, known as the \"father of the hydrogen bomb,\" suggested building large nuclear weapons to protect the planet. Russian scientists supported the idea.\n\n\"It was strange to see these weapons experts working together to make the biggest bombs ever,\" said Melosh, who studies asteroid impacts and even has an asteroid named after him.\n\nMelosh, however, believes nuclear weapons are not the best solution. He thinks we can safely push asteroids off course using battering rams instead of bombs. He has been arguing this for years but faced a setback recently. Last month, U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz signed an agreement with Russia to collaborate on nuclear-related projects, including asteroid defense.\n\nPresident Barack Obama has said he wants a world without nuclear weapons. Yet, NASA is spending money to study how nuclear weapons could stop asteroids. U.S. nuclear labs also seem interested in working with Russian scientists on this issue.\n\nSome experts worry this focus on asteroids could lead to building more nuclear weapons, which are less needed for other purposes. David Wright, from the Union of Concerned Scientists, said he hopes this doesn't turn into a \"jobs program\" for weapons scientists. He added, \"We need to make sure this is done for the right reasons.\"\n\nCritics compare the idea to the movie *Armageddon*, where a team plants a nuclear bomb on an asteroid to save Earth. Some also warn that exploding an asteroid could spread radioactive debris, causing harm on Earth. There are also international treaties, like the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, that ban nuclear weapons in space.\n\nBong Wie, from Iowa State University, is working on a project funded by NASA to design a system using both a battering ram and a nuclear bomb. The ram would hit the asteroid first, creating a crater, and then the bomb would blow it apart. Another researcher, Keith Holsapple, is studying how impacts or explosions could push an asteroid off its path.\n\nDavid Dearborn, a U.S. physicist, is one of the strongest supporters of the nuclear solution. He argues that nuclear weapons can work against asteroids and has spent years researching this. He says nuclear weapons could either push an asteroid off course if detected early or blow it apart if time is short. He believes no new weapons would need to be built, but stopping a large asteroid might require using one of the most powerful bombs in the U.S. arsenal.\n\nMark Boslough, another scientist, agrees that nuclear weapons might be the only option if an asteroid is discovered late. Melosh disagrees, saying we have enough time to use non-nuclear methods, like battering rams, lasers, solar sails, or even pulling asteroids off course. He warns that building new nuclear weapons for asteroids is risky and unnecessary.\n\nThe U.S.-Russia agreement signed last month does not specifically mention asteroids. It focuses on other nuclear-related work, like energy projects. However, some officials, like Donald Cook of the U.S. National Nuclear Security Administration, support working with Russia on asteroid defense. Russia, too, is considering nuclear options. A Russian official recently said non-nuclear methods may not work well against asteroids.\n\nChristopher Chyba, an expert from Princeton University, believes the threat from large asteroids is small but real. He supports research into different ways to stop them, including nuclear options, just in case."

        "gpt": "RALEIGH, N.C. — North Carolina State University (N.C. State) has a unique new library. It isn’t like regular libraries with books. Instead, it holds 98,000 glass vials and small cloth samples. These contain dyes and other materials donated by Eastman Chemical Company.\n\nChemistry students are working hard to turn this collection into an online database. When they finish, investigators and researchers worldwide can search for information about the dyes. The database will include 3D models of molecules and details about their properties.\n\nThe university hopes to get $785,000 from the National Institute of Justice to fund the Max A. Weaver Dye Library. This library is part of N.C. State’s growing focus on forensic science. The university has started a Forensic Sciences Institute and is planning the state’s first master’s program in forensic science.\n\nThe dye library will help investigators trace dyed fibers from clothing, car interiors, furniture, and carpets. It will work like a database used by police for car paint. The library will also be useful to scientists in many fields.\n\n\"This is about advancing science for the good of everyone,\" said David Hinks, a textile chemistry professor and director of the Forensic Sciences Institute. \"The collection is amazing, and we’re just starting to see what it can do.\"\n\nThe dyes could help chemists create eco-friendly colors, help doctors treat cancer, or even improve solar panels. Some dyes may help the military make better camouflage that absorbs infrared light, making soldiers harder to spot with night-vision devices. For cancer treatments, some dyes might highlight cancer cells so surgeons can see them better or even kill them with laser energy.\n\nThe collection was donated by Eastman Chemical Company after David Hinks spoke with a company leader, Stewart Witzeman. The dyes, collected since the 1940s, were famous in the textile world. But after the U.S. textile industry declined, the collection was no longer used. Other universities wanted it, but N.C. State offered the best plan.\n\nThe dyes are stored in N.C. State’s College of Textiles. The collection was too large to count completely, so the university estimated the total number. The vials hold powders, crystals, and small nuggets, with faded labels showing hand-drawn diagrams of the molecules.\n\nUndergraduate students are digitizing the dyes, turning their details into a searchable database. So far, they’ve only completed about 1,000 dyes. It will take years to finish, even with 20 students working during the school year and more in the summer.\n\nThe database will be free to use, but N.C. State may charge fees for extra details, such as how dyes react to sunlight. This money would help run the library. In the future, the university hopes to grow the collection by asking other companies to donate unused dyes.\n\nThe dye library is named after Max Weaver, a chemist who worked at Eastman for 29 years. Weaver, who passed away in 2012, was a dedicated inventor with more than 260 patents. He was known for his careful work and kind personality. Most of the dyes in the library were created by him or people he mentored.\n\nOnce the library is online, it will preserve Weaver’s and others’ work for future generations."

        "gpt": "SEATTLE — Alice Finch built a huge Lego version of Hogwarts Castle from the \"Harry Potter\" books by J.K. Rowling. The castle is shaped like an L, with each side 13 feet long and 5 feet wide. It has lots of tiny details, like colorful bottles in the Potions classroom, green plants in the greenhouse, small pictures on the grand staircase, and even a clear ghost in the Ravenclaw Towers. It took her a year to finish.\n\nShe used about 400,000 Lego pieces to make it.\n\nAlice, a former middle-school teacher, lives with her family on Mercer Island, Washington. She is an AFOL, which means Adult Fan of Lego. Her Hogwarts creation, which AFOLs call a \"build,\" was shown at BrickCon 2012, a big Lego event near Seattle. It won two awards: Best in Show and People’s Choice.\n\nThe next year, Alice worked with another Lego fan, David Frank, to build Rivendell, a place from J.R.R. Tolkien’s books. They used 200,000 Lego pieces to make it look colorful and full of life. This build also won an award.\n\nAlice’s love for Lego started when she was a kid, but she only began making big projects recently. Her Hogwarts idea came from reading the \"Harry Potter\" books with her son and her interest in buildings. Her dad was an architect, and Alice likes noticing building details when she travels.\n\n“The difference between a good builder and a great builder is the details,” she said.\n\nAlice was featured in a Lego documentary called \"A Lego Brickumentary.\" The film says Lego is like a universal language, as people all over the world have played with the bricks since the 1940s.\n\nAlice moved to the Seattle area in the 1990s and says it’s a great place for Lego fans. “It rains a lot, and there are many creative, smart people here,” she said. She is part of SeaLUG (Seattle Lego Users Group), which has around 150 members. Many of them focus on specific things like castles, space, or robots. She’s also in a smaller group, ArchLUG, which builds Lego architecture. They are working on a project inspired by the \"Mouse Guard\" books for BrickCon 2015.\n\nAlice teaches Lego camps for kids and hopes her work will inspire more girls to play and create with Lego. When she first showed her Hogwarts build, people were surprised to learn a woman made it. She didn’t start building to get attention but thinks her work can encourage others. “If girls see a woman doing it,” she said, “they might think they can do it too.”\n\nAlice’s favorite Lego partners are her two sons, Thorin, 11, and Hadrian, 7. “We’re always building together,” she said. She called it a great way to bond with her kids. She and Thorin made a Lego project based on \"How to Train Your Dragon.\" Hadrian, when he was 5, added his own touch to Rivendell by building a train station for the elves.\n\n“He wanted the elves to have a way to get to work,” Alice said. “It was his way of being part of the build.”\n\nAlice’s amazing creations show what can happen with a pile of Lego bricks, time, and imagination. “Lego is like its own language,” she said. “You can share ideas by building together.”"

        "gpt": "ORLANDO, Fla. — In the documentary *Blackfish*, an activist claims that killer whales at SeaWorld die young, while wild killer whales live as long as humans. This statement, which is not questioned in the film, suggests that orcas suffer in man-made pools.\n\nSeaWorld, however, disagrees. The company says its whales live as long as wild ones. They argue this shows their parks provide a healthy, stimulating home for the 29 killer whales they own.\n\nThe truth is more complicated. Scientists don’t know for sure how long killer whales live. Experts say both sides — SeaWorld and anti-captivity activists — use selective data to support their arguments. This has made it harder to have a clear discussion about keeping killer whales in captivity.\n\n“Both sides twist the numbers,” said John Hargrove, a former SeaWorld trainer. Hargrove, who appears in *Blackfish*, wants to end captivity but also criticizes extreme animal rights groups. “This debate needs facts,” he said.\n\nOne problem is that scientists have only studied a small number of wild killer whales, mostly in the Pacific Northwest. Killer whales live all over the world and have different types, or “ecotypes.” For example, salmon-eating orcas in the Pacific Northwest may live longer than mammal-eating orcas in other regions.\n\nStudies on Pacific Northwest killer whales show that females live an average of 30 to 50 years, and males live 19 to 31 years. Some live much longer — up to 90 years for females and 70 years for males. Most of SeaWorld’s whales are much younger, with only one living into her 40s.\n\nComparing life spans between wild and captive whales is tricky because of limited data. Scientists say it’s better to compare “annual survival rates,” which measure how many whales survive each year.\n\nOne study of wild killer whales in Alaska found survival rates of 97 to 99 percent, depending on age. In 1995, a study of captive whales showed a survival rate of about 93 percent, meaning captive whales were dying at a rate three times higher than wild ones.\n\nThis older study is often cited by activists and was used in *Blackfish*. But newer research shows captive whales are surviving longer. A recent study found survival rates for captive whales have improved to about 98 percent in the past decade. SeaWorld says its whales have had similar survival rates over the last 20 years, thanks to better care and veterinary practices.\n\nHowever, most of SeaWorld’s whales are still young, so it’s too early to know if their life spans will match wild whales. SeaWorld’s claim that their whales live as long as wild ones is based on survival rates, not actual lifespans.\n\nBoth sides have made questionable statements. In *Blackfish*, Howard Garrett, from The Orca Network, says wild killer whales live as long as humans. While some orcas do live that long, studies show their average lifespan is shorter. Garrett later admitted his comment was an oversimplification.\n\nThe film also shows a SeaWorld employee telling visitors that killer whales live longer in captivity because of veterinary care. However, there is no evidence that captive whales live longer than wild ones. SeaWorld denies training staff to make such claims, but they do teach employees to say that some animals, like dolphins, live longer in captivity — and that this might someday be true for killer whales.\n\nIn the end, the debate over keeping killer whales in captivity is complex, and both sides have used data in ways that can mislead the public."

Military recruiters set up booths in theaters, hoping to attract young people inspired by Cruise’s character, Maverick, who bragged about his daring flying moves.\n\nThe movie wasn’t just popular—it helped the Navy recruit thousands more people. That year, the Navy signed up 16,000 more recruits than the year before. For naval pilots, the number of new sign-ups grew by 500%. *Top Gun* didn’t just inspire future sailors and pilots; it also marked a big moment for teamwork between Hollywood and the military. While they had worked together since the 1920s, *Top Gun* took this partnership to a whole new level.\n\nNow, Hollywood is working with another big name: NASA. NASA isn’t focused on war like the military; instead, it’s all about exploring space and learning new things. NASA played a big role in the movie *The Martian*, a thrilling story about an astronaut, played by Matt Damon, who gets stranded on Mars. The film made over $100 million in its first weekend and got people excited about space again. \n\nNASA used the movie to teach people about real science. They explained how the technology in the movie works, talked about Martian dust storms, and encouraged young women to follow the example of the movie’s strong female leader, Commander Melissa Lewis. Right before the movie came out, NASA even announced it had found liquid water on Mars—a discovery that seemed perfectly timed to boost interest in the film.\n\nAlthough the story starts with NASA making a big mistake—accidentally leaving an astronaut behind on Mars—it turns into a tale of survival and teamwork. The movie shows NASA as a hero, working hard to bring the astronaut home. The movie, based on a book by Andy Weir, is very positive about NASA. Even if it weren’t, NASA says it doesn’t try to change movie scripts, unlike the military.\n\nThe military has a long history with Hollywood, but it’s sometimes been controversial. After *Top Gun*, the Pentagon used its cooperation as a bargaining tool. If a filmmaker didn’t show the military in a good light, they wouldn’t get access to military equipment like ships or tanks for their movie. This led to fewer anti-war movies and more films that glorified the military. Over time, this caused tension, especially as real wars became more unpopular with the public.\n\nNASA’s work with Hollywood doesn’t carry this kind of political baggage. NASA mainly helps filmmakers get the science right and focuses on education. It doesn’t have military equipment to offer, so its relationship with the film industry feels less complicated. For *The Martian*, NASA gave filmmakers a behind-the-scenes look at its space center, answered questions from real scientists and astronauts, and explained how things like ion engines and artificial gravity work.\n\nNASA has worked with Hollywood before on movies like *Armageddon*, *Men in Black III*, and the *Transformers* series, but those films didn’t inspire young people to study science or technology. *The Martian* is different. For the first time since *Apollo 13*, a government science agency is a main character in a movie—and it’s portrayed as a hero. This could spark more interest in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) careers, which experts say are important for the U.S. to stay ahead globally.\n\nThree decades after *Top Gun*, NASA is finally catching up to the military in using Hollywood to inspire the next generation."

He shared his support for the families of people killed in shootings at two Jewish community centers in Kansas City.\n\n\"Nobody should have to worry about being safe when they gather to pray,\" Obama said during the annual Easter prayer breakfast at the White House. \"No one should be afraid to go to their place of worship. Our government will give all the help needed to investigate this.\"\n\nObama said he had a personal connection to two of the victims. A teenager and his grandfather, who were shot in a parking lot near the Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City, went to the United Methodist Church of the Resurrection. Obama explained that the church’s pastor, Rev. Adam Hamilton, had given a sermon at his second inauguration and had attended last year’s prayer breakfast at the White House. The pastor told his church about the tragedy during their Palm Sunday service.\n\n\"This happened as Jews were getting ready for Passover and Christians were celebrating Palm Sunday, which makes it even more heartbreaking,\" Obama said.\n\nPolice arrested Frazier Glenn Miller, 73, for the shootings. Civil rights groups say Miller has connections to the Ku Klux Klan and has a long history of spreading hate against Jewish people and others. Police believe Miller did not know the victims.\n\nObama asked religious leaders to \"keep working together across different faiths to fight ignorance and hate, including anti-Semitism, which can lead to violence.\"\n\n\"This Easter week, we remember there is a lot of pain and wrong in the world, but we are also reminded of the grace of a loving God,\" Obama said. \"We are all God’s children, made in His image, and deserving of love and respect. Around the world, we see what happens when violence based on religion appears. It has no place in our society.\"\n\nObama also spoke about his recent visit to Vatican City, where he met Pope Francis for the first time. Obama, who is not Catholic, said he admired the pope for focusing on fairness and welcoming everyone into the church.\n\nThe president encouraged religious leaders to listen to the pope’s message.\n\n\"The pope asks us to see the value in every person,\" Obama said. \"But it’s also about what he does—hugging a homeless man or washing the feet of someone others might ignore. He reminds us that no matter who we are, we must live with kindness and humility because that is the example we say we follow.\""

        "gpt": "Mars has a very thin atmosphere, less than 1% as thick as Earth's. But long ago, Mars had rivers and lakes, meaning it must have had a thicker atmosphere. Where did it go? NASA’s MAVEN spacecraft is trying to solve this mystery. MAVEN entered Mars' orbit on Sunday, September 21, to study the planet's atmosphere.\n\nBruce Jakosky, the lead scientist for MAVEN, says one big question about Mars is whether it ever had life. Life, as we know it, needs liquid water. MAVEN will study Mars' current atmosphere and look back in time to see how it changed and disappeared. This will help scientists learn if Mars was ever habitable.\n\nMAVEN launched in November 2013 and traveled for 10 months to reach Mars. On Sunday night, it completed a tricky move to enter Mars’ orbit. Over the next six weeks, it will adjust its orbit and prepare its eight instruments to start collecting data in November.\n\nNASA hopes to work with India's Mars Orbiter Mission, which is set to arrive at Mars just three days after MAVEN. MAVEN will study the upper atmosphere, while the Indian spacecraft will focus on the surface and atmosphere. If India’s mission succeeds, it will be the first Asian spacecraft to reach Mars. NASA and India plan to share data to learn more about Mars.\n\nMars’ atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide, with small amounts of other gases like nitrogen and oxygen. Scientists believe the atmosphere either sank into the ground or escaped into space. MAVEN will study how gases are lost into space, possibly due to the solar wind. This could help explain how Mars lost most of its atmosphere over time.\n\nMAVEN will also get a rare chance to study a comet called Siding Spring, which will pass very close to Mars on October 19. Dust and gas from the comet hitting Mars' atmosphere will create a natural experiment, helping scientists learn more about the comet and Mars' atmosphere. Such a close comet approach happens only once in a million years.\n\nMAVEN is part of NASA’s efforts to study Mars. It joins other spacecraft like Mars Odyssey, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and the Curiosity and Opportunity rovers. Europe’s Mars Express orbiter is also active. These missions aim to find out if life could have existed on Mars and prepare for future human exploration. NASA sees each discovery as a step toward the day humans walk on Mars."

        "gpt": "Scientists have spent a lot of time trying to predict the future of plants and animals on Earth. But fewer studies focus on the extinctions that have already happened. Looking at the past can help us understand how extinction rates have changed, what causes them, and how they affect nature.  \n\nA new study by a scientist from Macquarie University in Australia looked at recent extinctions in reptiles and amphibians. The findings are alarming. The study shows that about 200 frog species have already gone extinct, and many more could disappear soon.\n\nJohn Alroy, a professor at Macquarie University, decided to do this study after a journalist asked him how many species have already gone extinct. He couldn’t find a study that answered this question, so he researched it himself. He focused on reptiles and amphibians because there was a lot of data available, and frogs, in particular, are known to be in trouble in many areas.\n\nUsing a method called the Bayesian approach, Alroy studied museum records and documents to estimate when certain animals, like frogs, salamanders, snakes, and lizards, were last seen. He found that frogs are the most at risk. His research suggests that more than 3% of all frog species have disappeared, mostly since the 1970s. The study predicts that if this continues, nearly 7% of frogs could vanish in the next 100 years.\n\nThe study says about 200 frog species are already gone, and hundreds more could disappear soon. Alroy explained that his method is conservative, meaning the real number of extinctions might be even higher. This could lead to a global mass extinction, which is very rare in Earth's history.\n\nThe extinction rate for reptiles and amphibians is about 10,000 times higher than for other animals. Frogs are the hardest hit, but snakes and lizards have lower extinction rates. Alroy said snakes and lizards seem to handle environmental changes better than frogs.\n\nFrogs are often called a \"canary in the coal mine\" because they are very sensitive to problems in the environment. Scientists already knew frogs were vulnerable, but Alroy found surprising patterns. Most frog extinctions happened in Central America, but there were also losses in places like Brazil, Madagascar, and New Guinea, even in areas without obvious causes.\n\nScientists don’t know exactly why so many frogs are dying. Possible reasons include habitat destruction and a deadly fungus called *Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis*. However, there isn’t a clear link between these factors and all the extinctions. Some areas with high extinction rates have the fungus, while others do not. This makes it hard to figure out what's happening.\n\nAlroy said more fieldwork is needed to understand what is killing frogs in different areas. Once scientists know the causes, they can try to stop the losses. He also said researchers should look at a wide range of causes, not just focus on climate change. While climate change is important, other factors like habitat destruction and invasive species also play a big role. Alroy hopes his study will lead to more research on these issues."

        "gpt": "LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. — Major League Baseball (MLB) plans to stop home plate collisions. This could happen as early as next season, but no later than 2015.\n\nSandy Alderson, the New York Mets general manager and head of the rules committee, announced this on Wednesday during the winter meetings. The main reasons are to keep players safe and prevent concussions.\n\n\"We want to change the idea that these collisions are normal and just part of the game,\" Alderson said. \"The injuries and health risks are too serious to keep things the way they are.\"\n\nBaseball is a sport with many traditions, so banning these collisions is a big change. MLB is also increasing the use of instant replay next season to fix bad calls.\n\nPete Rose, a former player, disagrees with the change. \"What's next? You can't break up a double play? You can't pitch inside?\" Rose said in a phone interview. \"Now you can't try to score at home plate? The people making these rules must not have played baseball.\"\n\nRose is known for a famous collision in the 1970 All-Star Game, where he hit catcher Ray Fosse. Rose said Fosse was blocking the plate without the ball, which is already against the rules.\n\n\"Baseball has been fine since 1869,\" Rose added. \"The only big rule changes were lowering the pitching mound and adding the designated hitter (DH). I thought the game was doing just fine.\"\n\nAlderson said the new rule will be written and shared with team owners for approval at a meeting on January 16. \"We’re still figuring out the exact wording and how we’ll enforce it,\" he said. \"We’ll look at many plays to decide which ones are OK and which ones we’ll ban.\"\n\nThe players’ union also needs to approve the rule for it to start in 2014. If they don’t agree, the rule would be delayed for one year but could still happen after that.\n\nThe union hasn’t commented yet because they’re reviewing the proposal.\n\nTalks about banning collisions became serious after a 2011 injury to Buster Posey, a catcher for the San Francisco Giants. Posey was hit by Florida’s Scott Cousins and broke a bone in his leg and tore three ligaments in his ankle, ending his season. Posey came back in 2012, won the National League batting title and MVP, and helped the Giants win the World Series.\n\n\"This is about injuries and concussions,\" Alderson said. \"These collisions hurt both runners and catchers. Concussions are a growing problem in all sports, not just baseball, and we need to address it.\"\n\nOther sports have also faced concussion issues. The NFL settled a lawsuit with former players for $765 million, and hockey players recently sued the NHL over concussions.\n\nFormer catchers Joe Girardi, Bruce Bochy, and Mike Matheny, now MLB managers, were at the meeting. Matheny, who manages the St. Louis Cardinals, said the change is influenced by what’s happening in other sports, not just baseball.\n\nNot everyone supports the change. \"I got hurt a few times as a catcher, but I thought it was part of the job,\" said Girardi, now the Yankees’ manager. \"I liked the contact, but not everyone does.\"\n\nMLB plans to have different punishments for collisions. \"There will be two levels of enforcement,\" Alderson said. \"On the field, a runner could be called out for hitting the catcher on purpose.

        "gpt": "HOUSTON — \"Affluenza\" is a term a psychologist used to argue that a wealthy Texas teenager should not go to prison for killing four people while driving drunk. However, experts say this is not a real medical condition and should not excuse bad behavior.\n\nA judge gave 16-year-old Ethan Couch 10 years of probation instead of the 20-year prison sentence prosecutors wanted. This decision upset the families of the victims and raised questions about the defense's argument. The psychologist said \"affluenza\" made Couch unable to understand consequences because he was spoiled by his rich upbringing.\n\nThe term \"affluenza\" became popular in the 1990s after Jessie O'Neill wrote a book about how wealth can make children feel entitled and irresponsible. Dr. Gary Buffone, a psychologist, explained that the term describes spoiled behavior but was never meant to defend crimes. \"A simpler way to say it is 'spoiled brat,'\" Buffone said. He criticized the judge for giving Couch a light punishment for such a serious crime.\n\nJudge Jean Boyd sentenced Couch after he pleaded guilty to killing four people in a drunk driving accident in June. During the trial, a psychologist said Couch grew up in a troubled home with parents who argued and divorced. Prosecutor Richard Alpert argued that Couch's wealthy family shielding him from consequences could lead to more tragedies.\n\nThe judge said Texas juvenile justice programs might not give Couch the therapy he needs. Instead, his parents will pay for him to attend a $450,000-a-year rehab center in California. This decision led some to question whether wealth influenced the case.\n\nLegal expert Richard Segura said he had never heard of \"affluenza\" as a defense. He questioned the idea that being rich and spoiled should reduce punishment. However, Segura noted the defense attorney likely used this argument to influence the judge, who may have considered rehabilitation and other factors when sentencing Couch.\n\nDr. Suniya Luthar, a psychologist who studies the effects of wealth on children, said Couch's sentence sends a dangerous message. Her research shows that many wealthy teens believe their parents will protect them from consequences. She asked if a poor child from a struggling neighborhood would have received the same leniency. \"We are setting different rules for the rich and poor,\" she said.\n\nAuthorities said Couch and his friends stole beer from a store before the crash. Couch was speeding with seven passengers in his truck and had a blood-alcohol level three times the legal limit. His truck hit and killed four people: Brian Jennings, 43; Breanna Mitchell, 24; Shelby Boyles, 21; and Hollie Boyles, 52.\n\nCouch’s lawyer, Scott Brown, said the judge’s sentence keeps Couch under the justice system’s supervision for 10 years. He argued that if Couch had received a 20-year prison sentence, he could have been released in just two years."

        "gpt": "### PRO: Leaving Afghanistan now could turn success into failure  \n\nWASHINGTON — Henry Kissinger, a famous former U.S. leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner, once said, \"Leaving on our own terms is not winning.\" He was talking about how the U.S. leaves wars, like Vietnam and now Afghanistan.  \n\nKissinger knows the pain of leaving too soon. After working on a peace deal to end the Vietnam War, he watched as the U.S. stopped supporting South Vietnam. The result was a disaster. The North took over, and violence spread to other countries. Millions suffered. This also made America’s enemies stronger.  \n\nSome people, like current Secretary of State John Kerry, think leaving Vietnam was a good thing. But how we left caused much harm to our allies. We abandoned them and left behind a tragic mess.  \n\nKissinger warns that history might repeat itself in Afghanistan. The situation there could fall apart, just like Vietnam. The U.S. government’s current plan for Afghanistan is similar to how it left Iraq. Once the immediate danger is gone, the U.S. leaves. But just because things seem calm for now doesn’t mean the job is done.  \n\nThe U.S. doesn’t need to stay forever, but it also shouldn’t leave too quickly. After a war, some help is needed to make sure peace lasts and the government becomes stable.  \n\nWhat happened in Iraq shows what can go wrong. The U.S. didn’t keep a small group of troops there to help, even though it could have. When the U.S. left, terrorist groups filled the gap. Violence rose, and Iraq became much more dangerous.  \n\nAfghanistan could face an even worse outcome. Groups like the Taliban and al-Qaida are still active. Drug trade fuels the fighting. If the U.S. leaves completely, all the progress made could be lost.  \n\nThe U.S. went to war in Afghanistan and Iraq to stop terrorists who had attacked and threatened America. While the goal wasn’t to bring freedom to these countries, the U.S. always hopes to leave behind a chance for better lives.  \n\nSadly, leaving Afghanistan now could turn victory into defeat. Future leaders will have to deal with the fallout, and it could cost even more. As Kissinger said, \"Leaving on our own terms is not winning.\"  \n\n### CON: Invading countries with tribal conflicts was a mistake  \n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio — The problems in Iraq and Afghanistan today are not because the U.S. is leaving. They’re because the U.S. invaded in the first place.  \n\nThe U.S. has learned a tough lesson: its military can remove governments, but it can’t control what replaces them. This is important as some people now talk about military action in other places, like Syria.  \n\nIn Iraq, President George W. Bush didn’t think much about what would happen after removing Saddam Hussein, Iraq’s leader. His father, President George H.W. Bush, avoided this mistake in 1991. He knew removing Saddam would cause chaos because Iraq’s Sunni minority ruled over the Shiite majority. Removing Saddam would upset this balance and lead to violence.  \n\nWhen the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003, this is exactly what happened. The Shiites took over and started settling old scores with the Sunnis. Violence broke out, and it continues today.  \n\nThe new Shiite-led government also became friendly with Iran, a U.S. rival. By invading Iraq, the U.S. unintentionally helped Iran gain more influence.  \n\nIn Afghanistan, the U.S. removed the Taliban, but Afghanistan has many ethnic groups and no history of a strong national government. Now, warlords are regaining power. Current president Hamid Karzai is resisting U.S. demands to keep troops in the country after 2014.  \n\nThe U.S. didn’t have to invade either Iraq or Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, the U.S. asked the Taliban to hand over Osama bin Laden. The Taliban was starting to respond, but the U.S. invaded anyway.  \n\nIn Iraq, the U.S. said it invaded because Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. This turned out to be false.  \n\nBoth wars caused huge harm to the U.S. and the countries involved. Thousands of people died, were injured, or suffered. Now, Iraq and Afghanistan are in ruins, and their governments are struggling.  \n\nIf the U.S. doesn’t like how things turned out, it has only itself to blame."

        "gpt": "The Sierra Nevada red fox, a very rare animal, was recently seen in Yosemite National Park for the first time in almost 100 years.\n\nThe fox, one of 14 animals protected by California, was caught on motion-activated cameras on December 13 and January 4. Park officials are not sure if it was the same fox or two different ones.\n\n“It’s very rare to see one,” said park spokesperson Kari Cobb.\n\nThe Sierra Nevada red fox is one of the rarest animals in North America, with fewer than 50 left. The last time one was seen in Yosemite was in 1915.\n\nThese shy animals avoid people. They live in burrows made in dirt or logs at high elevations, about 6,000 feet above sea level. Because they are so hard to find, not much is known about them.\n\nIn 1990, cameras in Lassen National Forest filmed one during a study on wolverines. Hoping to spot another, scientists set up cameras in Tioga Pass, where the fox had been seen before. Finally, in August 2010, a Sierra Nevada red fox was photographed near Sonora Pass, north of Yosemite. \n\nThe fox was caught on video biting a bait bag filled with chicken scraps. Scientists at the University of California, Davis, tested saliva from the bag and confirmed it was from a Sierra Nevada red fox.\n\nTwo years ago, Cobb and her husband saw one during a deer hunting trip near Sonora Pass. “They are very cute and majestic,” she said.\n\nResearchers will keep using cameras to track the fox. They’ve also set up stations to collect hair samples for DNA testing. This will help them learn more about the fox and see if it is related to the one seen near Sonora Pass.\n\nCobb said the recent sighting is a positive sign. Yosemite’s large protected areas may help the Sierra Nevada red fox recover and grow in number."

        "gpt": "TOKYO — Chikara Yamanobe is very different from a typical sumo wrestler. He is so skinny you can see his ribs, and he cries when he gets pushed around in the ring. He is also just 5 years old.\n\nEven so, Chikara, whose name means \"power,\" dreams of becoming a professional sumo wrestler when he grows up.\n\n\"I want to be like Endo,\" he said after training for nearly three hours one Sunday morning at a dojo in northern Tokyo. Endo is a famous Japanese sumo star.\n\nBut Chikara probably won’t achieve his dream.\n\nSumo, Japan’s traditional sport, is losing popularity. It has strict rules, Shinto rituals, and wrestlers need to be big and heavy. However, many boys in Japan now prefer sports like baseball, which is very popular in the country. Sumo is rarely shown on TV during prime time, and it doesn’t have cool merchandise like jerseys or hats.\n\nIn recent years, sumo has been dominated by foreign wrestlers. At a recent grand tournament, the winner was Terunofuji Haruo, a Mongolian wrestler. Other top wrestlers included more Mongolians and a Bulgarian. Wrestlers from Hawaii, the Pacific Islands, Egypt, and Georgia have also been successful.\n\nSumo’s decline is partly because people are moving away from old traditions. For example, the number of geisha is also falling. Becoming a professional sumo wrestler is very tough. Boys must leave school at 15 and live in a \"stable,\" where their hairstyle, diet, and daily life are strictly controlled.\n\nAnother problem is that sumo is not easy for kids to try. Big matches are shown on TV in the afternoon when many children are at cram school. Sumo arenas are mostly filled with older people and tourists.\n\n\"They’re losing young fans,\" said Mike Wesemann, an American who writes about sumo. He added that other sports are more appealing. \"Fathers might take their kids to play soccer or baseball, but they’re not going to say, ‘Let’s practice sumo.’ And kids can wear jerseys for baseball or soccer, but they can’t walk around in a loincloth to show their love for sumo. Sumo just isn’t seen as cool.\"\n\nThe Japan Sumo Association knows there’s a problem. Kento Nakazawa, who works for the group, runs a yearly sumo class for kids. It’s held in six locations, but only 50 to 60 children usually attend. \n\n\"We want to give kids a chance to try sumo,\" Nakazawa said. \"Even if just one child gets interested, we’ll be happy.\"\n\nThe Japan Sumo Federation, which supports amateur wrestlers, is also trying to attract kids. They organize tournaments for junior high students. Noboru Yoshimura, a leader in the federation, said he is worried about sumo’s decline. Even though martial arts became part of the school curriculum in 2012, kids often choose kendo or judo instead of sumo.\n\nTo help, the federation now offers a three-day training course for teachers. \"Sumo doesn’t require much equipment, so it’s easy to start,\" Yoshimura said. \"We’re promoting it that way to get more kids involved.\"\n\nParticipation in the Wanpaku sumo tournament for children has dropped. In 1994, 70,000 kids joined, but by 2014, only 33,000 participated. To attract more interest, qualifying rounds are now held in places like Mongolia and Hawaii.\n\nAt a dojo in Asakusa, a Tokyo neighborhood known for its temple, boys were spending hours practicing. They did exercises, wrestled with coaches, and helped each other with small injuries. Older boys followed traditions by holding towels for their coaches. They also helped younger boys, fixing their loincloths and showing them how to practice.\n\nMost boys practice sumo only until high school. After that, it gets much more serious. Girls and women are generally not allowed in the ring because of tradition.\n\nToshiyo Abe watched his 6-year-old son, Shotaro, practice. Shotaro started sumo a year ago after seeing a tournament. Now, they take an hour-long train ride to the dojo every weekend. \n\n\"I’m a bit jealous of how much fun he’s having,\" Abe said. He admitted he used to wish Japanese wrestlers would work harder when Mongolians began winning. But then he thought about how Japanese baseball player Ichiro Suzuki succeeded in America. \"It’s just the way things are,\" he said.\n\nSome parents worry about the weight gain needed for sumo. \"Some high school clubs make boys eat until they throw up,\" said Akiteru Kiyomiya, who was watching his sons, 13-year-old Itto and 10-year-old Kenshi. \"But if this is what they want to do, I’ll support them.\"\n\nTheir mother, Yumi Kiyomiya, wasn’t as sure. \"I don’t want them to get too big,\" she said. \"I just give them healthy meals.\"\n\nAfter four hours of training, coach Shinju Taira, a former professional wrestler, said he is concerned about sumo’s decline. \"Not everyone will go pro, but we’re trying to raise future leaders for society,\" he said.\n\nHisao Yoshiyoka, whose two sons were training, said she was happy with what her boys were learning. \"They’re gaining confidence and understanding Japanese traditions,\" she said. \"At first, younger boys are scared to step into the ring. But as they learn, they become braver.\"\n\nHer youngest son, 7-year-old Ryudai, has already picked his future sumo name. By 2030, he hopes to become a grand champion called Dairyu."

        "gpt": "LOS ANGELES — President Barack Obama decided not to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow next month. This happened after Russia gave Edward Snowden, who leaked U.S. government secrets, temporary asylum. The White House announced this on Wednesday.\n\nThe decision wasn’t just about Snowden. The U.S. is also frustrated with Russia over other issues like missile defense, arms control, trade, and human rights.\n\nThe White House released a statement saying, “After careful review, we decided there hasn’t been enough progress in U.S.-Russia relations to hold a meeting in early September.”\n\nThe U.S. values working with Russia on some topics, like the New START Treaty and issues in Afghanistan, Iran, and North Korea, said White House press secretary Jay Carney.\n\nWhile in California, Obama said he was “disappointed” that Russia gave Snowden asylum for a year. However, he noted that the two countries still cooperate on things like Afghanistan and the Boston Marathon bombing investigation.\n\n“There are times when Russia still acts like it’s the Cold War,” Obama said on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.\" “I keep telling them and President Putin, ‘That’s in the past.’”\n\nOn Friday, U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and Secretary of State John Kerry will meet with Russian officials in Washington to discuss the relationship between the two countries.\n\nObama and Putin already have a strained relationship. They disagree on Syria’s civil war, Russia’s ban on U.S. adoptions of Russian children, and human rights issues. Obama has also criticized a Russian law that bans “nontraditional” sexual relations. He told Leno, “I have no patience for countries that mistreat gays, lesbians, or transgender people.”\n\nSnowden is accused of sharing government secrets about surveillance programs. He fled to Hong Kong, then to Russia. He stayed in a Moscow airport for over a month before Russia gave him asylum.\n\nRussia has also accused the U.S. of building a missile defense system in Eastern Europe to target them.\n\nObama will still attend the G-20 economic summit in St. Petersburg in September, but he will not meet with Putin in Moscow. Instead, he will visit Sweden.\n\nObama and Putin last met in June at the Group of 8 summit in Northern Ireland. The U.S. told Russia it would be better to delay the meeting until there’s more progress on shared goals.\n\nSome experts on U.S.-Russia relations were disappointed. Matthew Rojansky, an expert on Russia, said, “This doesn’t help improve the relationship. It just says, ‘We have more important things to do.’”\n\nHowever, U.S. lawmakers supported Obama’s decision. Many were upset that Russia gave Snowden asylum. Rep. Ed Royce, a Republican, said this shows Russia’s actions are unacceptable. Sen. Charles Schumer, a Democrat, called Putin a “schoolyard bully” and said canceling the meeting was the right move.\n\nThe G-20 summit will happen in St. Petersburg on Sept. 5-6. Before the summit, Obama will visit Sweden for the first time. The White House said Sweden is a strong partner and works with the U.S. on trade, clean energy, and protecting the environment."

        "gpt": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. — A small girl, about 9 or 10 years old, looked out of a window in a cotton mill in Lincolnton, N.C., where she worked.\n\nIn 1908, Lewis Hine, known as the father of American documentary photography, took her photo. This picture became one of over 5,000 he took while working for the National Child Labor Committee. His photos showed the harsh realities of child labor in factories and other workplaces.\n\nHine’s photo captions usually included names, but this girl was only described as a \"spinner\" at the Rhodes Manufacturing Co. Another photo showed her with an older girl and a woman, but their names were also missing.\n\nNow, a researcher from Massachusetts, Joe Manning, believes he has solved the mystery of who they were. Manning, an author and historian, has spent years finding the names of people in Hine’s photos. He looked through the 1910 Lincolnton census records and made a list of girls born around 1898 who had slightly older sisters. One name stood out: Lala Blanton.\n\nManning shared this name and the photos on his website, hoping someone would recognize them. Two months later, Myra \"Carol\" Cook from Louisville, Ky., contacted him. She thought the girl in the photo might be her grandmother, who spelled her name \"Lalar Blanton.\"\n\nCook sent Manning pictures of her grandmother as an adult. Manning showed them to Maureen Taylor, a photo expert. Taylor confirmed that the faces matched. Manning and Cook are now sure the girl in the picture is Lalar Blanton.\n\nManning feels proud when he identifies people in Hine’s photos. \"These children were more than workers in factories,\" he said. \"They were real people with lives and stories.\"\n\nManning’s interest in Hine’s work started nine years ago when a friend asked him to find out more about a girl in one of Hine’s photos. Since then, he has worked to connect the children in the photos with their modern-day families.\n\nAnother researcher, Robert Allen, a professor at UNC Chapel Hill, praised Manning’s dedication. Allen has also studied Hine’s photos and helped organize events to honor the children in them. These photos remind us of how children worked in factories long ago, a practice that ended with child labor laws in 1938.\n\nFor Cook, the discovery of her grandmother in Hine’s photo was emotional. She remembered her grandmother as a strong and caring woman who had a tough childhood. Lalar had to quit school in second grade to work in the mill. Cook said her grandmother was protective of children and wanted her to have a better life.\n\nCook began researching her family history a few years ago. When she saw her grandmother’s name on Manning’s website, she finally had proof that the girl in the photo was her grandmother. She also recognized the other people in the second photo as her great-grandmother, Susie Black Blanton, and her great-aunt, Ellen.\n\nThe discovery brought mixed feelings for Cook. \"It’s sad to think of what she went through,\" Cook said. \"But it also makes me proud. She’s part of American history.\"\n\nCook’s daughters gave her reprints of the photos as a gift. As Cook looks at the picture of her grandmother by the window, she wonders what Lalar was thinking. \"I don’t know,\" Cook said, \"but I’m sure of one thing: She wanted me to have a better life. She didn’t get to be a little girl, but she made sure I could be one.\""

        "gpt": "SAN JOSE, Calif. — The Internet moves so fast that people in the Bay Area can connect with New York City quicker than you can finish a sentence.\n\nThat’s very fast, but it’s still not quick enough for musicians. They dream of a future where sound travels at the speed of light so the whole world can play music together at the same time.\n\n“The delays are a big problem,” said sound expert Elizabeth Cohen. “A 30-millisecond delay feels like an echo. It’s too long for music.”  \n\nMusic is about sharing and quick feedback, Cohen explained. She helps save music for global exchanges over the Internet.\n\nTo fix this, a team led by Brighten Godfrey, a computer scientist at the University of Illinois, started a project in October. Their goal, funded by Google, is to make the Internet as fast as the speed of light. They call it “Networking at the Speed of Light.” \n\nIf they succeed, we could have faster chats, smoother videos, and musicians from faraway places like Hawaii and Antarctica could play together perfectly.\n\nThe problem is called latency, which means the time it takes for a message to travel across the Internet. Right now, data moves about 10 to 100 times slower than the speed of light.\n\nFor example, connecting San Francisco to New York takes about one second on most networks. At light speed, it would take only 27 milliseconds. (A millisecond is one-thousandth of a second.) \n\nThis matters because the human ear can only hear two sounds as happening at the same time if the delay is less than 20 milliseconds. Musicians in the same city can play together online, but it’s much harder if they’re far apart. Even at light speed, musicians on opposite sides of the Earth would still have a 133-millisecond delay.\n\nInternet companies also care about speed. Delays cost them money. For instance, if Google searches take 400 milliseconds longer, fewer people use the service, according to a study by Godfrey’s team.\n\nGoogle is funding this project to reduce delays. “We want our services to reach users faster,” said Maggie Johnson, a Google director.\n\nTechnology is already changing music. People take lessons and audition online. Composer Eric Whitacre even created a “Virtual Choir” by combining 2,052 voices from all over the world into one track.\n\nBut playing live music together online is still a challenge. “A faster Internet would help me hear clearer sounds and make better musical decisions,” said Joe Weed, a music producer.\n\nThere are several reasons for Internet delays. Signals slow down in glass fiber-optic cables. The “last mile” of the Internet, which connects to homes, is often too narrow to carry data quickly. Networks also store data in memory buffers, which can slow things down.\n\nBut some industries, like high-frequency trading, have shown it’s possible to be faster. For example, in the 1980s, it took 14.5 milliseconds for data to travel between New York and Chicago stock exchanges. Today, microwave technology has cut that to 8.5 milliseconds, just slightly slower than light speed.\n\nA recent concert at Stanford University showed how fast Internet can connect musicians. Using a high-speed network called Internet2, 13 musicians played together from Stanford, UC Santa Barbara, Virginia Tech, and a university in Mexico. They performed a mix of classical, folk, and electronic music.\n\n“It’s like a big party line,” said Chris Chafe, a Stanford scientist and musician who set up the event. The musicians could hear each other as if they were in the same room.\n\nIt took 46 milliseconds for sounds from Virginia Tech to reach Stanford, and another 46 milliseconds for Stanford’s sounds to return to Virginia. Sounds from Mexico’s flute arrived in 46 milliseconds, while Santa Barbara, being closer, took only 7 milliseconds.\n\nThe performance wasn’t perfect. Sometimes loud, glitchy noises interrupted the music, and a musician had to lower the volume. Still, the audience loved it and clapped enthusiastically.\n\nThis worked because Stanford’s Internet is fast, and the music was slow, Chafe explained. If they had tried to play fast, rhythmic music, it would have been harder.\n\nThe first step in solving Internet delays is figuring out what causes them. This means studying every part of the Internet, from fiber cables and routers to servers and apps.\n\n“Thirty years ago, we couldn’t have imagined what we have now,” said Godfrey. “Now, we’re trying to go even further and connect the whole world in real time.”"

        "gpt": "STANFORD, Calif. — Trent Edwards, a former Stanford quarterback, is back on campus, but this time he's not throwing passes. Instead, he's showing off new virtual-reality (VR) technology that could change football.  \n\nEdwards wears a VR headset, and what he sees appears on a big screen. The audience watches as he looks around, appearing to stand in the middle of a live Stanford football practice. He sees the defense, a tight end moving, and a running back behind him. \"I'm feeling it right now,\" Edwards says, caught up in the moment.\n\nThen, he almost steps off the stage. Luckily, Stanford professor Jeremy Bailenson, an expert in VR, makes a joke to lighten the mood, saying someone should invent airbags for the headset. But the message is clear: VR could be the next big thing in football.\n\n**How VR Helps Football**  \nThis VR system, created at Stanford, lets players experience game-like scenarios without being on the field. Quarterbacks can practice reading defenses, while coaches can give backup players extra practice without risking injuries. It also helps reduce physical contact, which lowers the risk of concussions.  \n\nNFL teams like the 49ers and Cowboys, along with college teams such as Arkansas, Clemson, and Stanford, are already using it. Stanford coach David Shaw, who usually avoids new tech, was impressed by this system. He even helped fund the company behind it, STRIVR Labs.  \n\n**How It Works**  \nSTRIVR uses cameras to film real practices in 360 degrees. Players then watch the footage through a headset, seeing exactly what the quarterback would see. It feels more real than traditional game videos and helps players react faster and make better decisions.  \n\nFor example, Stanford quarterback Kevin Hogan used the VR headset before his last three games one season. His completion rate improved, and Stanford won those games by large margins. Coach Shaw believes the VR practice helped Hogan think faster and play better.  \n\n**The Start of STRIVR**  \nThe idea began in 2005 when Derek Belch, a Stanford kicker, took a class on VR taught by Bailenson. Belch thought VR could train football players. Years later, he worked with Bailenson to create STRIVR. Now, their technology is helping teams across the country.  \n\n**Real-World Practice**  \nUnlike video-game-like systems, STRIVR uses real footage. This makes it more useful for players to practice solving real problems, like a teammate dropping a mouth guard during a play.  \n\nTeams can also simulate different conditions, like loud stadiums, rain, or nighttime games. This prepares players for challenges they might face on game day.  \n\n**The Future of Football Training**  \nFor now, the technology is expensive, so only NFL and big college teams can afford it. But Shaw believes VR will soon be part of every top football program. It helps coaches see what players see, making feedback faster and more accurate.  \n\nThis new tool could change how football players train, making the game smarter and safer."

He’s getting help from some surprising mentors: talent agents from Beverly Hills.\n\nFor four years, agents from William Morris Endeavor (WME), a big Hollywood talent agency, have been helping students from two Compton schools. The program includes regular visits to WME’s fancy offices on Wilshire Boulevard.\n\n“At first, I was nervous and scared because I didn’t know anyone,” said Edgar, who goes to Whaley Middle School. “But now we’re close, and they feel like friends.”\n\nThe program benefits both students and mentors. Nancy Josephson, one of Edgar’s mentors and a mom of three, says working with Edgar has taught her a lot about parenting. “Edgar is so happy, even without all the fancy things,” she said.\n\nWME is a famous talent agency with big clients like Oprah Winfrey and Justin Timberlake. But instead of just focusing on Hollywood, WME decided to help schools. They’ve spent over $1 million improving Foster Elementary and Whaley Middle School. They’ve fixed bathrooms, upgraded playgrounds, added murals, and even created edible gardens with the help of Food Network star Giada De Laurentiis.\n\nThe heart of the program is mentoring. Every other week, students visit WME to eat lunch and spend time with their mentors. The mentors help with homework and talk about life. Tytis Barnett, a seventh-grader at Whaley, said, “They help with homework, and after that, we can have fun.”\n\nWME treats the schools like their Hollywood clients. “We ask, ‘What problems does the school have, and how can we solve them?’” said Patrick Whitesell, WME’s co-CEO.\n\nThe program started in 2009 after WME merged with another agency. They wanted their charity work to make a real difference in education. They partnered with Jacqueline Sanderlin, the principal at Foster Elementary, who inspired them with her passion for helping students.\n\nBefore WME got involved, the bathrooms at Foster were so bad that kids avoided using them. WME fixed them with a $50,000 donation. They also improved the school’s library, added computers, and even upgraded the teacher’s lounge.\n\nThe mentoring program pairs 42 agents with 19 students. Students visit WME’s offices for one-on-one talks and activities. Nancy Josephson says Edgar’s dream of going to college is inspiring. “Seeing this workplace full of college graduates makes an impact,” she said.\n\nThe program has helped Foster’s test scores improve over the years. But experts say not every school will have a WME to step in. “Every school should have clean bathrooms and good resources, no matter what,” said UCLA professor John Rogers.\n\nWME’s commitment to the schools is ongoing. They hope other businesses will follow their example. They’ve even started similar programs in Brooklyn, London, and Nashville. Some students from Compton now dream of becoming talent agents themselves, and WME’s leaders are excited about that. “We’re ready to help them achieve their dreams,” said co-CEO Ari Emanuel."

Lions are one of the \"Big Five\" animals, but their habitats are shrinking due to human activity. Recently, a U.S. dentist killed a famous lion in Zimbabwe, causing outrage worldwide. Critics say trophy hunting is putting Africa's wildlife at risk.\n\nIn Kenya and Botswana, hunting is banned. These countries rely on tourists who come to see animals in the wild. However, countries like South Africa, Namibia, and Tanzania allow hunting. They argue it helps local communities and funds wildlife conservation. Opponents say rules are often ignored by dishonest operators.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, a professional hunter named Theo Bronkhorst was charged for not stopping an illegal hunt. He was guiding Walter Palmer, the American dentist who killed Cecil, a well-known lion with a black mane. Conservationists claim Cecil was lured out of a protected park using a dead animal. Palmer first injured Cecil with a bow and later killed him with a gun after 40 hours of tracking. Palmer said he trusted his guides to follow the law. He has since faced backlash and shut down his dental practice.\n\n\"Cecil is not the first lion to be lured,\" said Ian Michler, a South African conservationist. \"Unethical hunting happens a lot.\" Michler made a film called *Blood Lions*, which says about 1,000 lions bred in captivity are killed each year in South Africa by trophy hunters. Hunters pay between $20,000 and $50,000 for these kills. Some lion owners also charge tourists to pet lion cubs, which are later killed when they grow up.\n\nSouth Africa claims its hunting industry follows international rules and helps protect species like lions, elephants, and rhinos. Environment Minister Edna Molewa said hunting brings foreign money, creates jobs, and supports communities. She welcomed South African Airways' decision to allow legal hunting trophies to be transported. Molewa said hunting in South Africa is worth $490 million a year, but some conservationists think this number is exaggerated. A 2013 report estimated trophy hunting brings $200 million to African communities but said this is a small part of overall tourism revenue.\n\nLions are listed as vulnerable on an international \"red list\" of endangered animals. There are fewer than 20,000 lions in the wild, a 40% drop in the last 20 years. Some estimates say the number may be closer to 30,000. While lion conservation has been successful in southern Africa, lions in West Africa are critically endangered, and populations in East Africa are also declining.\n\nCecil, the lion killed in Zimbabwe, was wearing a tracking collar from a research group at the University of Oxford. The group studies threats to lions and uses technology to find solutions. They have tracked over 100 lions by satellite. \n\nPrince Mupazviriho, a Zimbabwean government official, said hunting a collared lion was a rare case. He explained that controlled hunting can bring money for conservation, as long as it is done scientifically and not randomly.\n\nIn May, Zambia ended a two-year ban on hunting lions and other big cats. Meanwhile, a group called Central African Wildlife Adventures offers lion hunts in the Central African Republic. However, they have paused operations due to violence in the area. Their website describes hunting a lion as a special moment where hunter and lion face each other as equals. It says, \"At close range, the lion appears suddenly, and the final meeting begins between two powerful predators.\""

        "gpt": "Removing top predators, like big fish, has been called one of the biggest ways humans are harming nature. This is as bad in the ocean as it is on land. People like to eat large predatory fish, such as tuna, swordfish, grouper, and sharks, more than smaller fish like sardines and anchovies. This makes fishermen focus on catching the bigger, more valuable fish first. They often fish these species so much that their numbers drop too low to recover. Then, they move on to smaller fish lower on the food chain. This pattern is called \"fishing down the food web.\"\n\nScientists who first used this term have studied how much predatory fish populations have dropped since industrial fishing began. They looked at over 200 food-web models from around the world, which included over 3,000 ocean species. Their research found that humans have reduced predatory fish populations by more than two-thirds since the 20th century, with most of the decline happening after the 1970s.\n\nMany of these large fish species are now in serious trouble. According to a global conservation group, 12% of grouper species, 11% of tuna and billfish species, and 24% of shark and ray species are at risk of extinction. Losing these predators doesn’t just reduce the amount of fish people like to eat—it hurts the entire ocean ecosystem. Predators keep prey populations under control. Without them, prey species can grow too much, causing problems for other plants and animals. For example, kelp forests, which are home to many important species, have been destroyed because sea urchins, which eat kelp, became too numerous. This happened because their predators, like sea otters, disappeared. \"Predators are key to keeping ecosystems healthy,\" says professor Villy Christensen, the lead scientist of this study. \"When large fish populations collapse, it can take decades for them to recover.\"\n\nIn the U.S., things are starting to get better. Science-based fishing rules have helped rebuild 34 fish populations since 2000. Now, over 90% of U.S. fish populations are not overfished. However, the situation is worse in many other parts of the world. The United Nations says nearly 30% of the world’s fish populations are overfished. \"The biggest problem is in developing countries, where there aren’t strong systems for managing fisheries,\" says Christensen. \"We need better management everywhere, or the consequences will be severe.\"\n\nThis new research gives important facts for the global discussion about how much fish we should take from the ocean. It shows that we’ve been catching too many predatory fish, which are important both for the economy and for the environment. To fix this, international groups that manage fishing need to do more. Fishing quotas for many species must be lowered, and the existing rules must be followed. If we don’t act, we risk losing these fish and damaging the health of our oceans."

        "gpt": "CHICAGO — For over 10 years, Chicago has been a leader in using green roofs. Now, the city is moving forward with another idea: growing food on roofs. This trend is spreading to other cities too.\n\nRooftop farms are appearing all over Chicago. For example, since 2013, the McCormick Place convention center has grown thousands of pounds of food. A factory in the Pullman neighborhood is building what will soon be the biggest rooftop farm in the world. Small businesses and schools are also joining in.\n\nSteven Peck, who started Green Roofs for Healthy Cities, says we’re just starting to see the potential of green roofs and rooftop farms. He explains that they help use space that otherwise goes unused. Across the country, there’s growing interest in creating spaces to grow food in cities.\n\nPeck says people in crowded cities want fresh, local food and to feel closer to nature. However, rooftop farming is still new, so it’s too early to know how much it will help food production.\n\nChicago has at least 13 rooftop farms, according to Peter Strazzabosco from the city’s planning department, though there might be more. Other cities like Washington, D.C., and Toronto also have rooftop farms, but fewer than Chicago.\n\nMichael Bryson, a professor at Roosevelt University, says urban farming is important. It helps change how food is grown and delivered. He points out that where and how we grow food also affects transportation, energy use, and pollution.\n\nBryson says rooftop farms are a great fit for Chicago, which has been a leader in green projects. The city is turning empty spaces into places that grow fresh, affordable food for neighborhoods that need it.\n\nIn 2000, former Mayor Richard M. Daley installed Chicago’s first green roof on City Hall. Since then, the city has become a leader in green roofs, with over 5.5 million square feet of green roofs on more than 500 buildings. However, this is still a small number compared to the city’s many buildings.\n\nTo support urban farming, Chicago passed a law in 2011 allowing rooftop farms. Now, Gotham Greens, a company from New York, is opening the world’s largest rooftop farm in the Pullman neighborhood. The farm, built on a factory for Method, an eco-friendly soap company, will cover 75,000 square feet and produce as much food as a 40-acre farm.\n\nGotham Greens chose Chicago because of its green initiatives and strong local farming community. They plan to grow leafy greens, which are hard to store and often need to travel long distances. The greens will be sold to local stores, restaurants, and markets.\n\nAnother rooftop farm, run by the Chicago Botanic Garden, is located on McCormick Place West. Since 2013, it has grown about 10,000 pounds of food each year with the help of students in an educational program. The farm focuses on a small number of crops, like kale, lettuce, peppers, and tomatoes, to grow food more efficiently.\n\nSmaller farms are also being developed. Tracy Boychuk, for example, started The Roof Crop, a company that builds rooftop farms for businesses and individuals. The company rents out the space to grow crops and sells the produce to local markets.\n\nBuilding rooftop farms can be tricky. Roofs can only hold a limited amount of weight, and extreme weather, like strong winds, can make farming difficult. Transporting supplies to rooftops can also be a challenge. However, experts agree that the benefits of rooftop farming are worth it.\n\nGreen roofs help reduce stormwater runoff, keep buildings cooler in the summer, and last longer than traditional roofs. They also improve air quality and reduce the heat in cities, making urban areas more comfortable.\n\nRooftop farms also provide learning opportunities. Programs like those at McCormick Place and the Chicago Botanic Garden train students and give young people hands-on experience with farming.\n\nFor people like Boychuk, rooftop farming is about more than just growing food. It’s a way to reconnect people with fresh, healthy food. She believes that many health problems come from being disconnected from good food and that rooftop farming can help change that."

        "gpt": "BALTIMORE — In Easton, Maryland, a forgotten story about free African-Americans is being uncovered. Bits of glass, pieces of pottery, and oyster shells are helping archaeologists and historians learn about \"The Hill.\" They believe this is the oldest settlement of free African-Americans in the United States, starting in 1790.\n\nTreme, a neighborhood in New Orleans, is often called the oldest free Black community in the U.S., dating back to 1812. But the discoveries in Easton might change that.\n\n\"This isn’t just a Black story; it’s an American story,\" said Dale Green, a professor at Morgan State University.\n\nFormer slaves built communities like The Hill. They gained their freedom early and were able to own property and start businesses. Historians believe The Hill was created by slaves who bought their freedom or were freed by Quakers and Methodists on Maryland’s Eastern Shore. It may have been the largest community of free African-Americans in the Chesapeake Bay area.\n\nIn 1790, the first U.S. census recorded 410 free African-Americans living on The Hill. This was more than the 250 free African-Americans in Baltimore and more than the 346 slaves at nearby Wye House Plantation, where Frederick Douglass was enslaved as a child.\n\nToday, researchers and students are digging into the history of The Hill. They are working on land owned by the Talbot County Women’s Club, digging in small 5-by-5-foot sections. The deeper they go, the older the artifacts they find.\n\nIn the top layers of dirt, they found 20th-century items like toys and marbles. Deeper down, they found things from the 1800s, said Stefan Woehlke, a graduate student from the University of Maryland who leads the dig. He showed a piece of an old olive-green wine bottle with a grape design. The bottle was made by hand in the late 1700s or early 1800s. Other finds include a blue glass pitcher from the 1800s and a 1-cent coin from 1794.\n\nMore importantly, they found evidence of nail-making and chicken farming on the land. These activities were likely done by free African-Americans who lived there.\n\n\"It’s like putting a puzzle together,\" Woehlke said.\n\nFree African-Americans on The Hill lived next to white families, said Green, who is working with Mark Leone from the University of Maryland on this project. In 1790, the property was owned by James Price, a white man. The census recorded three free African-Americans living there, but it didn’t give much detail about them.\n\nResearchers say they have just begun to uncover the history of The Hill. \"It’s like a puzzle where you don’t have all the pieces,\" Woehlke said. The team plans to work on the site for at least five more years.\n\nSince the dig began, over 500 people have visited the site. Some came on tours, while others stopped by after seeing signs about the excavation.\n\nPriscilla Morris, who has family roots in Easton going back to the 1600s, visits the site often. She is a member of the nearby Quaker group, Third Haven Friends Meeting. She is interested in how Quakers and Methodists freed their slaves and fought against slavery long before the Civil War.\n\n\"It’s exciting because we always thought there was something here we didn’t understand,\" Morris said. She explained that most history books skip over the lives of free African-Americans. \"It was always the plantation owners telling the story,\" she said. \"No one told us about this large, free Black community.\"\n\nGreen believes the work on The Hill could change how American history is taught. He says the story of free African-Americans has been ignored for too long.\n\nThere are big plans to share this story with others. These include museum exhibits, tourism programs, academic papers, and even a screenplay funded by a local business owner.\n\nThe Hill is already listed in the National Register of Historic Places, which recognizes Easton’s historic district. That listing will now be updated to include African-American history. \"So when people read it, it won’t just be about white Easton,\" Green said.\n\nAbout 75 researchers and students from different universities and local groups are working on this project. Tracy Jenkins, a graduate student in archaeology at the University of Maryland, plans to write his dissertation on The Hill. He said the Easton community has been very welcoming and supportive, which is rare in archaeology.\n\n\"Usually, archaeologists are digging in a quiet field somewhere,\" Jenkins said. But in Easton, the researchers and residents are working together. Jenkins hopes his work will tell an important story, not just sit on a shelf.\n\n\"I like sharing stories that haven’t been told,\" he said."

        "gpt": "WASHINGTON — Big movie stars like Mark Wahlberg, Kurt Russell, and Kate Hudson are coming to Louisiana this year to film a movie about the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil rig disaster. Many people in Louisiana may be excited, but some are starting to wonder if giving big tax breaks to attract movies is worth it.\n\nLouisiana offers unlimited tax breaks to movie companies to film there. This started back in 1992, and now 39 states and Puerto Rico have similar programs. Supporters of these tax breaks say they create jobs for people like carpenters, electricians, caterers, and drivers. But critics argue these jobs don’t last long, and the state loses more money in tax breaks than it earns back.\n\nRight now, Louisiana doesn’t put a limit on how much it gives out in tax credits. But that could change. The Louisiana House recently voted to cap the credits at $200 million a year. This is part of a larger plan to reduce tax breaks because the state has a big budget problem, with a $1.6 billion shortfall. Some lawmakers want to cut or eliminate these credits, but not everyone agrees.\n\nOther states are also rethinking their film tax credits. Alaska decided to end its program early because the state is losing money from falling oil and gas revenue. Massachusetts is debating whether to keep its $80 million film tax credit, with some saying the money could be better spent helping low-income workers. In Michigan, lawmakers are split on whether to continue funding their film credits.\n\nWhile some states are cutting back, others are increasing their support. California, for example, tripled its film tax credits to $330 million to keep Hollywood productions in the state. Maine is also considering new tax breaks to compete with nearby Massachusetts, which has attracted many film projects.\n\nMovie studios often choose where to film based on tax deals. For example, Netflix’s \"House of Cards\" threatened to leave Maryland unless the state extended its tax credits. Maryland ended up giving $62.5 million in credits between 2012 and 2016 to \"House of Cards\" and other productions.\n\nCritics say these tax breaks cost too much for the jobs they create. A report showed Louisiana spent $231 million in credits in one year, with taxpayers paying $60,000 for every job created. Some studies argue these programs don’t bring in enough money to cover their costs. States often have to cut spending on other things, like schools or transportation, to make up for the lost tax revenue.\n\nSupporters of the tax breaks, like the Motion Picture Association of America, say the programs help the economy by creating jobs and bringing in spending on local businesses. In Louisiana, a study claimed film productions supported over 10,000 jobs and generated $1.59 billion in economic activity in 2013.\n\nStill, some experts think states shouldn’t try to force industries to grow where they don’t naturally fit. For example, economist Matthew Mitchell said, \"With enough incentives, you can grow oranges in Maine, but that doesn’t mean it’s a good idea.\"\n\nFor now, states continue to compete with each other to attract movie productions, offering bigger and better tax deals. But many are questioning whether these programs are really worth the cost."

        "gpt": "WICHITA, Kan. — Thieves are using a simple trick to steal big shipments of goods. They pretend to be truck drivers, take the cargo, and drive off with it.\n\nThis type of theft is a growing problem. It’s called commercial identity theft. Thieves steal millions of dollars in goods every year, mostly food and drinks. Experts say it’s becoming the most common way to steal freight.\n\nYears ago, thieves would just take loaded trucks from parking lots. But now, trucking companies use GPS, strong locks, and other security tools. So, criminals have found new ways to trick people.\n\nThe Internet has made it easier for thieves. They can find information about trucking companies online. They steal the identity of real trucking companies, pretending to be them. Then, they search for valuable goods they want to take.\n\nThese thefts hurt the trucking industry, which moves most of the goods across the U.S. They also hurt consumers by raising prices. Worse, stolen food or medicine could be unsafe and still end up in stores.\n\nHere are some examples of what’s been stolen:  \n- 80,000 pounds of walnuts worth $300,000 in California.  \n- $200,000 worth of cheese in Wisconsin.  \n- $82,000 in rib-eye steaks in Texas.  \n- 25,000 pounds of king crab worth $400,000 in California.  \n\nA nut company in California was robbed twice. Thieves came with fake papers, picked up almonds, and drove away. On Monday, the company realized the almonds never arrived at their destination. \"Uh-oh. I think it happened again,\" said Raquel Andrade, the company’s manager.\n\nThese crimes are not widely known outside the trucking world. Many companies don’t talk about them because they don’t want bad publicity. But reports show this is a big problem. It raises prices and can even threaten people’s health.\n\nKeith Lewis from CargoNet, a theft-prevention group, said, \"In the end, consumers pay for this.\" The damage goes beyond the stolen goods. For example, if thieves steal medicine, companies might need to recall all products with the same batch number. This costs millions of dollars.\n\nStolen food is also risky. If it spoils and is sold, it could make many people sick. Lewis explained, \"A truckload of spoiled chicken could harm hundreds or thousands of people.\"\n\nHere’s how the scheme works:  \n1. Thieves use a government website to reactivate old trucking licenses for a small fee.  \n2. They pretend to be a trusted trucking company.  \n3. They create fake papers like insurance and driver’s licenses.  \n4. They offer low prices to companies needing to ship goods.  \n5. When they pick up the goods, they disappear with them.\n\nThey mostly steal food and drinks because these are easy to sell and hard to trace. Some goods are sold in small grocery stores. Others end up in big warehouses. In one case, police found stolen steaks, shrimp, energy drinks, and ice cream in a warehouse in California.\n\nIn 2022, nearly 1,200 cargo thefts were reported, with losses of about $216 million. Many thefts go unreported, so the real number is higher. The most common type of theft is still stealing trailers left alone in parking lots. But scams like fake pickups are growing fast. About 1 in 5 stolen truckloads now involve fake pickups.\n\nThis problem started a few years ago and is getting worse. Last year, LoJack, a company that tracks thefts, found 45 fake pickup cases. This year, that number has doubled. Each theft costs about $170,000 on average.\n\nThe biggest targets are places with busy ports or railroads. California has the most thefts, followed by Texas, Florida, and other states like New Jersey, Illinois, and Georgia.\n\nScott Cornell from Travelers Insurance said thieves use the Internet to set up fake companies and bid on shipping jobs. Keith Lewis added that in a few years, fake identity scams might become the main way to steal cargo.\n\nThieves are smart about what they steal. For example, someone wanting copper might target shipments from a copper factory in Georgia. Food and drinks are the most stolen items, making up 23% of thefts. Metals account for 16%, and electronics and household goods each make up 12%.\n\nFood is a common target because it’s less protected than electronics or medicine. Also, food doesn’t have serial numbers, so it’s harder to trace. Companies often don’t realize they’ve been scammed until days later when the goods don’t arrive. By then, the items are already sold on the black market.\n\nThe trucking and insurance industries are fighting back. They’re asking freight companies to be more careful. For example, they should check a trucker’s documents before giving them a job. The California Farm Bureau advises watching for warning signs like fake truck IDs and changes in pickup times. They also suggest asking for a thumbprint from the driver.\n\n\"This problem is growing fast,\" said Sam Rizzitelli from Travelers Insurance. \"It needs serious attention.\""

        "gpt": "PARIS — Bacon, hot dogs, and cold cuts are being criticized. On Monday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said processed meats can raise the risk of colon and stomach cancer. It also said red meat might be harmful too.\n\nMeat producers are upset. Vegetarians feel supported. Cancer experts welcome this strong statement linking meat-eating to cancer.\n\nThe WHO's cancer research group in France studied years of research. For the first time, they put processed meats in the same risk category as smoking and asbestos. This doesn’t mean processed meats are as dangerous as cigarettes, but there is a proven link to cancer, though the risk is small.\n\nIn the U.S., this news isn’t shocking. Many people already worry about chemicals in cured meats. The American Cancer Society has long warned against eating too much steak or deli meats. But in Europe, where sausages and smoked ham are very popular, this news might change people’s views. \n\nThe findings could also hurt the U.S. meat industry, which argues that cancer is caused by many factors, not just meat.\n\nColon cancer is the second most common cancer in women worldwide and the third most common in men, according to the WHO. In the U.S., though, colon cancer rates have been going down.\n\nA group of 22 scientists reviewed over 800 studies from around the world. These studies looked at different types of cancer in people with various diets over 20 years. The WHO group classified processed meats as “cancer-causing to humans,” mostly linked to colon cancer. Red meat was labeled “probably cancer-causing,” with possible links to colon, prostate, and pancreatic cancers.\n\nThe report didn’t say exactly how much processed meat is too much. But it said the risk increases the more you eat. For example, eating 50 grams of processed meat daily (about the size of a hot dog or a few slices of bologna) raises the risk of colorectal cancer by 18%.\n\nIn the U.S., the lifetime risk of getting colorectal cancer is about 5%. Eating processed meat every day would raise that risk to about 6%.\n\nExperts have long warned about chemicals like nitrites and nitrates in processed meats. These chemicals can turn into cancer-causing compounds in the body. Cooking meat at high temperatures, like grilling or smoking, can also create harmful chemicals.\n\nDr. Kurt Straif from the WHO said, \"The risk from processed meat is small for each person, but because so many people eat it, the global impact on cancer is important.\"\n\nThe WHO noted that about 34,000 cancer deaths each year worldwide are linked to diets high in processed meat. This is much lower than the 1 million deaths caused by smoking, 600,000 from alcohol, and 200,000 from air pollution.\n\nDoctors in wealthier countries have long advised people to eat less red and processed meat. This is not just because of cancer but also due to heart risks from fats and salt.\n\nThe WHO defined processed meat as meat changed to improve flavor or last longer, like sausages, beef jerky, or smoked products. Red meat includes beef, pork, lamb, goat, and similar meats. Cooking red meat at very high heat produces the most harmful chemicals.\n\nSusan Gapstur from the American Cancer Society said this report helps people make healthier choices. She suggests eating fish or poultry instead of red or processed meat and cooking red meat at lower temperatures.\n\nThe North American Meat Institute argued that cancer is a complex disease and not caused by one type of food.\n\nExperts say the report is important, but people shouldn’t panic. Gunter Kuhnle, a nutrition scientist, said eating a few slices of bologna daily raises cancer risk by 18%, but smoking three cigarettes a day increases lung cancer risk by 500%. He said while the findings matter, they shouldn’t scare people too much."

        "gpt": "WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama, in his State of the Union speech on Tuesday night, promised to take action on his own if Congress doesn’t help him reduce the gap between rich and poor. He announced small steps he can take, like raising the minimum wage for federal contract workers and helping low-income people save for retirement.  \n\n\"America doesn't stand still, and neither do I,\" Obama said to Congress and millions watching on TV.  \n\nHis speech was also a way to start the fight for control of Congress in the upcoming elections. Democrats want to show Republicans as not caring about middle-class people. Many Democrats cheered when Obama said he would use his powers to get things done without waiting for Congress.  \n\nObama called 2014 a \"year of action\" and tried to show people that he still has power, even if Congress is divided. After a tough year in 2013, his team now measures success by what he can do on his own, not by passing laws through Congress.  \n\nObama asked Congress to work on old ideas like fixing immigration, raising the federal minimum wage, and improving early childhood education. He also proposed a new idea to expand a tax credit for workers without kids.  \n\nRepublicans, however, blame Obama’s policies for the growing gap between rich and poor. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers said Republicans have plans to create jobs without adding more government spending or rules.  \n\nMost of Obama’s speech focused on the economy and other U.S. issues, like health care. He briefly talked about foreign policy, warning Congress not to pass new penalties on Iran while nuclear talks are ongoing. He also mentioned that U.S. troops are leaving Afghanistan this year.  \n\nAn emotional moment came when Obama praised Cory Remsburg, an Army Ranger who was badly hurt in Afghanistan. Remsburg stood up to long applause from everyone in the room.  \n\nWhile some parts of the economy are improving, many Americans still struggle with low wages or no jobs. Obama said, \"Even during recovery, too many people are working harder just to get by.\"  \n\nObama also defended his health care law, saying Americans don’t want to keep arguing about it, even though the program had problems when it started last year.  \n\nThe audience for his speech included survivors of the Boston Marathon bombing and others invited by both Democrats and Republicans.  \n\nObama highlighted his limits as president. For example, he can raise the minimum wage for new federal contracts but needs Congress to raise it for all workers. Republicans criticized this move, calling it too small to make a big difference. Obama responded by urging Congress to pass a nationwide wage increase, saying, \"Give America a raise.\"  \n\nObama also announced other plans, like helping workers save for retirement, creating job-training hubs, and encouraging cleaner fuels for trucks and cars.  \n\nThe president’s focus on taking action alone shows he hasn’t been able to end the political fights in Washington or get Congress to work together. Some Republicans warn his use of executive orders could make things worse with Congress.  \n\nStill, Obama hasn’t given up on Congress. He pushed for immigration reform, though many Republicans oppose his idea of giving 11 million undocumented immigrants a way to earn citizenship. Instead of repeating his full plan, Obama simply said, \"Let’s get it done.\"  \n\nHe also asked Congress to expand a tax credit that helps low-income workers. Some Republicans, like Sen. Marco Rubio, agree with this idea but suggest it as an alternative to raising the minimum wage.  \n\nOn foreign policy, Obama confirmed that the U.S. war in Afghanistan will end this year, though some troops might stay if Afghanistan agrees to a security deal. He also warned Congress not to pass new sanctions on Iran, saying it could harm ongoing nuclear talks.  \n\nIn closing, Obama promised to keep working to help Americans, with or without Congress."

It’s like a beginner’s class for lightsaber combat.  \n\nThe 90-minute class happens at I Am Equilibrium yoga studio in Doral, Florida. It was started by friends Alfred Smith and Santiago Martinez. They wanted to create a fun place where people could escape their everyday lives and play-fight with lightsabers.  \n\n\"We knew people would be interested because 'Star Wars' fans are everywhere,\" said Martinez, 38, who works in IT at a Miami bank. \"The movies may be old, but the ideas in them still connect to real life.  \n\n\"Who doesn’t want to be like Luke Skywalker or Han Solo? Who doesn’t want to swing a laser stick? This class lets me forget my problems and live out a fantasy.\"  \n\nSmith said he learned lightsaber moves by watching groups in San Francisco and New York City. Then, he created his own lessons with Martinez. The release of \"Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens\" helped boost interest in the class.  \n\n\"I’ve been into lightsaber combat for a while,\" said Smith, 40, who teaches yoga and works in marketing. \"I love martial arts and fight choreography, and this combines both. Plus, I’m a huge 'Star Wars' fan.\"  \n\nDuring a recent class, 17 people of all ages stood in rows, ready to learn. Some brought their own lightsabers that lit up and made sounds. Others used simple ones made from PVC pipes and pool noodles.  \n\nMany wore \"Star Wars\" shirts. One teen’s shirt said, \"Physically, I’m here. Mentally, I’m in a galaxy far, far away.\"  \n\nBefore learning Jedi moves, the students started with meditation and yoga.  \n\n\"This is about balance and focus,\" Smith told them as they practiced a tree pose. \"You need to stay present and focused throughout the class.\"  \n\nNext, the teachers showed basic lightsaber moves for defense and attack.  \n\nStudents stood with one foot forward, swinging their sabers in an “S” shape. They practiced hitting low, middle, and high areas.  \n\n\"Imagine you’re drawing an S,\" Smith explained as they worked in pairs.  \n\nThe students moved their sabers in a choreographed way, like a dance. The moves were both calming and energetic, just like the Jedi in the movies.  \n\nEach lesson had a Jedi theme.  \n\n\"A Jedi is always aware of everything around them,\" Smith said.  \n\nEven though the instructors were serious, some students laughed as they practiced. One person even wore a camera to record the class.  \n\nStudents learned moves like the \"flourish,\" where they spun the saber while moving forward or backward. They also practiced the \"bash,\" a quick strike that ends with pulling the saber back.  \n\n\"Think of it like a snake’s quick strike,\" Santiago said. \"Every 'Star Wars' movie starts with a move like this.\"  \n\nAt the end of the class, everyone meditated again.  \n\nThe students left smiling — and sweaty. Their arms were tired from swinging the sabers, but they agreed it was a fun workout.  \n\n\"You really feel like a Jedi,\" said Valerie Villar, 26, who came with her boyfriend, Gerry Brenes, 29. \"The sound of the saber makes it feel real.\"  \n\n\"It’s a great way to live out the Jedi dream,\" added Brenes. \"Plus, it helps you relax and focus.\"  \n\nVictoria Diaz, 17, joined the class to learn how to be a Jedi. She brought her best friend, Brittney Ellis, 18, to try it too.  \n\n\"It’s harder than it looks in the movies,\" Victoria said. \"The flourish was the toughest. If you’re bad at remembering steps, it’s tricky.\"  \n\nFor Frankie Andollo, 35, this was his third class.  \n\n\"I can be my nerdy self here,\" said Andollo, an IT consultant. He brought a replica of Luke Skywalker’s green lightsaber and wore a shirt from the new movie.  \n\n\"I love the 'Star Wars' story,\" he said. \"I’ve seen all the movies, read the books, and watched the shows. Now, I’m taking lightsaber classes. It’s clean, fun, and lets you follow your instincts.\"  "

        "gpt": "Edina's fourth-grade basketball team, made up of 9- and 10-year-old boys like Caylor, Gage, Tyler, and Torin, got to use a full-court press for the first time. They played hard and beat Cottage Grove 27-8 during a Saturday game in Burnsville, Minnesota. At halftime, they were already ahead 12-2. Coach Paul Schmidt talked to the team about their strategy and explained what \"inverted\" meant when discussing their plays.\n\nIn fourth-grade travel basketball, kids have to grow up quickly. Some people love the excitement of youth sports, while others think it's too intense. In Minnesota, youth basketball is becoming almost as competitive as youth hockey. \n\nMore kids are joining competitive basketball teams at younger ages. Ten years ago, only 20 fourth-grade boys' teams joined the Minnesota state tournament. Last year, 115 teams competed. Now, even third- and second-grade teams are starting to form.\n\nParents are driving this trend. Todd Breyfogle, whose son Easton plays for Edina, admitted he wasn’t sure about joining at first. He was frustrated when a tournament was scheduled two days after Christmas, which meant spending 14 hours in a gym. But by January, he was cheering loudly from the sidelines.\n\nEdina started its fourth-grade travel basketball program two years ago to keep up with other cities. \"We didn’t want to fall behind,\" said Paul Manley, Edina’s boys' travel director. Now, the program is thriving. Their annual Cake Eater Classic tournament drew 234 teams this year. Parents pay $500 for their kids to join one of Edina’s three fourth-grade teams. Schmidt’s team, the top-ranked one, will play at least 40 games this season. During tryouts last fall, 44 kids competed for spots, but 15 were cut after outside evaluators assessed them.\n\nSchmidt’s team started the season with a 4-9 record and even lost a game right after Christmas. By late January, though, they were winning more often. \"It’s really fun if you’re on a good team,\" said Schmidt’s 10-year-old son, Lleyton.\n\nRich Penick from the Minnesota Youth Athletic Services (MYAS) said parents are the ones pushing for younger kids to join competitive basketball. MYAS only added a fourth-grade state tournament because parents demanded it. Deborah Edwards from the Positive Coaching Alliance thinks kids are overscheduled. \"Travel basketball just adds to it,\" she said.\n\nDerek Sharrer, a basketball director in Woodbury, said travel basketball isn’t for every child. The time, travel, and cost can overwhelm parents. Some 9-year-olds aren’t ready for the pressure, he added. When kids are cut from teams, they try to frame it as a chance to play at a lower level instead.\n\nMany parents see basketball as a way to help their kids succeed. Giovanna Ingram pays $75 an hour for extra training for her son, Vinnie. She hopes he might earn a college scholarship someday. But she also wants him to stay healthy and out of trouble. Another parent, Mike Munson, tracks his son Tyler’s basketball stats on an electronic tablet and shares the data with the coaches. \"Tyler loves it,\" said Munson. \"He always says he’s having fun.\"\n\nMunson remembers playing basketball casually as a kid. \"We didn’t start travel basketball until seventh grade,\" he said. But now, he thinks the cost is worth it. \"It’s no different than paying for skiing,\" he explained. \n\nAt a scrimmage at the NBA’s Target Center, the kids got the full professional experience with spotlights and introductions. One parent, Leslie Curry, said she teared up watching her son Gage take the court.\n\nParents also spend a lot on gear. Doug Lundahl, whose son Jake plays for Edina, said basketball shoes, uniforms, and bags can cost hundreds of dollars. Some teams even have corporate sponsors, like Cargill or Lawn-N-Order, a local lawn-care company. Lundahl said the time commitment is huge, but the games are exciting. \"As a parent, you age real fast,\" he joked.\n\nHowever, the intense atmosphere can lead to problems. Twice in recent years, police were called to Edina’s Cake Eater Classic to calm down angry parents. In one case, a team refused to play until police arrived. Edina officials pointed out that no Edina teams were involved in these incidents.\n\nMic O’Brien, president of Edina’s youth basketball association, said they had concerns about starting fourth-grade travel basketball. But it was already becoming popular, so they decided to join in. When asked if third-grade travel basketball might be next, O’Brien sighed. \"I’m afraid so,\" he said. \"But we won’t be the first to start it.\""

It has seven words with \"ough,\" each said in a different way: oo, uff, oh, oh, oh, aw, aw. Isn’t English confusing?\n\nA group of experts from Britain and the U.S. thinks English spelling isn’t just hard to learn—it’s a real problem. They want to hold an International English Spelling Congress to create a simpler spelling system.\n\n“In languages like Finnish, Spanish, and Italian, words are written the way they sound,” said Stephen Linstead, leader of the English Spelling Society. “English is completely different.”\n\nLinstead explained that English has two big problems: Words with the same letters are said differently, and the same sound can be written in many ways. Experts from around the world would suggest new ways to spell tricky words—like those with \"ough\"—and the congress would pick a better system.\n\nThis isn’t just about fixing weird spellings. Linstead said studies in Britain show that kids learning English take much longer to read and write compared to kids in other European countries. He thinks the confusing spelling is part of the problem.\n\n“One of our members joined us because he had trouble teaching his kids to read using phonics,” Linstead said. “Every time he taught them a rule, there were so many exceptions.”\n\nThe American Literacy Council is also helping. Linstead admitted that changing English spelling everywhere would be a huge challenge. For example, Portugal recently changed its spelling rules to match the way Brazilian Portuguese is written, which is simpler. Even though this took years, many people still criticized it.\n\nThere have been efforts to change English spelling before. \n\nCol. Robert McCormick, who owned the *Chicago Tribune*, supported simpler spelling. His newspaper once used \"fantom\" instead of \"phantom\" and \"frate\" instead of \"freight.\"\n\nIn the early 1900s, the Simplified Spelling Board made a list of 300 easier spellings, like \"fixt\" instead of \"fixed.\" President Theodore Roosevelt supported this, but Congress rejected it.\n\nLinstead said this new congress is more of a grassroots effort, meaning it’s starting with regular people. He thinks changes might work better if society chooses what to use.\n\n“We want to highlight new research instead of forcing changes from the top down,” Linstead said."

        "gpt": "Rudo Boothe, a 33-year-old tech consultant from Miami Shores, Florida, believes his success comes from learning to read and do simple math when he was only 4 years old. Now, with his 19-month-old daughter, he makes sure to teach her these skills during everyday activities.\n\nFor example, when shopping, they talk about shapes and words while putting items in the cart. At home, they count down the microwave timer together.\n\n\"My goal is to make numbers important,\" Boothe said. \"I want her to be amazing by age 7.\"\n\nBoothe isn’t trying to compete with other parents. He’s focused on helping his child succeed in the future, especially financially. He believes studies, like one from the University of Edinburgh, that show strong reading and math skills at age 7 can lead to better jobs and higher salaries later in life. These early skills seem to matter more than intelligence, education level, or family wealth.\n\nTimothy Bates, a psychology professor from the University of Edinburgh, agrees. He found that kids who read better at age 7 earned about $8,000 more per year by age 45. After studying 17,000 people in the U.K. over 40 years, he saw that kids with good reading and math skills often ended up with better jobs, homes, and incomes than kids who had higher IQs or wealthier parents but weaker skills.\n\nIn the U.S., where success is often based on effort and skill, Bates thinks the effect could be even stronger. He says early skills, no matter your background, shape your future.\n\nHowever, many American educators point out that family income still plays a big role. Only 40-55% of U.S. kids attend good pre-kindergarten programs, says Libby Doggett from the Department of Education. These programs don’t just teach reading and math—they also help kids learn important skills like persistence and motivation.\n\nPoorer kids are less likely to attend these programs, says Greg Duncan, a professor at UC Irvine. This creates a gap between rich and poor kids in math and reading skills by kindergarten. Schools in low-income areas often struggle with less experienced teachers and other challenges, making it hard to close this gap. Duncan says much of the difference comes from what happens at home. Parenting makes a big impact.\n\nBut teaching kids doesn’t have to be hard. Silvia Tarafa, a school principal in Florida, says parents can make learning fun through everyday activities. For example:\n\n- Read nonfiction books about topics your child loves, like sharks or space.\n- Bake together and use measuring cups to teach fractions.\n- Compare prices at the store and pay with cash to practice subtraction.\n- Show how coins add up, like four quarters making a dollar.\n- Measure and frame their artwork to teach length, width, and perimeter.\n- Pack for trips by asking them to count how many shirts or pants they need.\n- Open a savings account and explain how money grows with interest.\n\nTarafa says kids who hear these ideas at home will understand them better when teachers introduce them at school. Parents play a big role in helping kids build these skills early on.\n\nAnd don’t forget: Some things, like multiplication tables, just need to be memorized!"

But Senegal had a simpler message for him: \"Welcome home.\"\n\nEverywhere Obama went on Thursday, his first full day in Africa during a weeklong trip to three countries, people greeted him warmly. Although Obama was born and raised in Hawaii, his father was from Kenya. On this day, Senegal treated him like one of their own.\n\nSigns saying \"Welcome home, Mr. President\" were hung on lampposts, and people wore T-shirts with his picture. Crowds danced and waved as they celebrated his visit.\n\nObama seemed happy to be there, shaking hands and taking pictures. But he also reflected on the shared history of slavery between Senegal and the United States. He and his family visited Goree Island, near Dakar, where enslaved Africans were once held before being sent across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nAt the island's small slave house, Obama stood at the \"door of no return,\" the place where enslaved people were forced onto ships. He spent about 30 minutes in the house, which has dark, cramped cells. \n\n\"Visiting this place as an African-American and as a president gives me even more reason to fight for human rights,\" Obama said later. He added, \"It reminds us to always stand up for what is right.\"\n\nThe visit was especially meaningful for the Obama family, as both Barack and Michelle Obama have ancestors who were enslaved. Barack's mother has ties to slavery, and Michelle's great-great-grandfather was freed from a plantation in South Carolina. The president said the visit helped his family understand the hardships enslaved people faced.\n\nThe slave house on Goree Island is a popular stop for world leaders and celebrities. Past visitors include Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, Nelson Mandela, Harry Belafonte, and Stevie Wonder. However, some historians debate whether the house was a major slave trading site. They believe it may have been a merchant's home instead. Still, the site holds powerful symbolic meaning.\n\nTour guides on the island tell emotional stories about slavery. Eloi Coly, the curator who led Obama's tour, said the experience is deeply moving for everyone. \"It is impossible not to feel it,\" he said. \"It touches all human beings.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, Obama spoke about the U.S. Supreme Court's decision supporting same-sex marriage. However, Senegalese President Macky Sall did not agree on this issue. Sall said Senegal is tolerant but not ready to change its laws on homosexuality. \"This does not mean we are against gay people,\" Sall explained."

        "gpt": "CHICAGO — Geologist Erin Argyilan has spent the last 10 months studying sand, wind, and the shape of the land at Mount Baldy in Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. But she hasn’t figured out why mysterious holes appear and disappear in the sandy dune.\n\n“This seems to be a new geological event,” she said.\n\nMany experts have searched the area to find out why these holes, which are about a foot wide, form. The holes are dangerous and seem to fill themselves in with sand within a day. Scientists have used special tools to look underground, but no one knows for sure why the holes appear on this popular landmark, which many people visit each year.\n\nThe National Park Service said this week that Mount Baldy will stay closed for now because two new holes and several dips in the ground were found on the north side of the dune. However, the rest of Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore is still open.\n\nArgyilan feels strongly about solving this mystery. In July, she was studying the dune when she heard parents screaming 400 feet away. Their 6-year-old son, Nathan Woessner, had fallen into a hole and was buried under 11 feet of sand. Rescuers saved him after three hours.\n\nAt first, Argyilan thought there couldn’t be a hole because dunes are made of tightly packed sand. But Nathan’s rescue shocked her and changed how she understood the dune. It also deeply upset her. \n\n“I cried for three days,” she said. At the time, she was seven months pregnant and couldn’t stop thinking about the event. “I couldn’t help then, so now I have to figure out why this is happening.”\n\nIn August, another hole was found nearby. It was 10 inches wide and at least 5 feet deep. This led to more research.\n\nOne idea is that old, buried trees are rotting under the sand, creating the holes. Mount Baldy has been eroding, or wearing away, because of human activity. The 126-foot dune is moving away from the lake, covering old land with sand. Experts think sand is burying trees, which then decay and leave empty spaces under the surface.\n\nArgyilan believes this problem is unique to Mount Baldy and probably won’t happen at other dunes that are more natural and untouched. \n\n“This dune has a complicated past,” she said.\n\nShe explained that years ago, people mined sand from the area to make glass jars. Structures like jetties, built to protect the harbor, may also have caused erosion. She has studied old pictures from 1938 and says the changes to the dune are dramatic.\n\nUnlike other dunes, which are covered in plants, Mount Baldy’s vegetation is buried. Even an old staircase that once led to a viewing spot is now under the sand.\n\nWhile Mount Baldy is closed, the National Park Service is planting grass to help hold the sand in place. They hope this will stop new holes from forming.\n\nArgyilan said these holes are different from sinkholes, which are caused by water wearing away rock. The holes in Mount Baldy are in sand, not rock.\n\nThis summer, the National Park Service plans to do more research. They will map the holes, use radar to look underground, and study samples of the sand and decayed material. The Environmental Protection Agency has already used radar to find unusual patterns under the surface, but no one knows for sure what is causing them.\n\n“We don’t know exactly what’s happening yet, so we can’t let people go there until it’s safe,” said Ken Mehne, a park official. He said the closure will likely last through summer and maybe into fall. \n\nThe rest of the lakeshore is open, but visitors are asked to stay on marked trails to avoid damaging the area.\n\n“There are 14.5 miles of other beaches in the park,” Mehne said. “There’s still plenty for visitors to enjoy.”"

She has made a series of paintings to celebrate the race, leaving out the sadness from the past.\n\nHer paintings show cheerful scenes from the marathon. One shows the famous \"Wellesley Scream Tunnel,\" where Wellesley College students cheer, give high-fives, and blow kisses to runners. Another, called \"Heartbreak Hill,\" captures the happiness runners feel after climbing the tough hill. \"The Home Stretch\" shows runners passing Boston’s Citgo sign as they head toward the finish line.\n\n\"I wanted to remember the marathon the way it used to be. I wanted it to feel fun again,\" said Phelan, 26, a painter and art teacher from Hingham, near Boston. She grew up watching the marathon every April.\n\nTwo years after bombs killed three people and injured over 260 in 2013, Phelan’s art reflects a wish from the running community. They want the marathon to return to what it was when it started 119 years ago: a simple race to see who was the fastest.\n\n\"It’s a springtime celebration,\" said Tom Derderian, a coach and author of a book about the Boston Marathon. \"A terrible crime happened, but over time, the marathon will be remembered more as a race and less as a crime scene.\"\n\nOn April 15, 2013, Phelan finished her first Boston Marathon in just over three hours. She was celebrating nearby when she heard the explosions. \"People were running and screaming. It was so scary,\" she said.\n\nTo cope with the trauma, Phelan made an emotional painting called \"Boston Marathon 2013.\" It was dark and moody, with splashes of red paint that reminded her of the blood on Boylston Street that day. \"I was just throwing paint at the canvas,\" she said.\n\nLast year, Phelan started creating brighter, happier paintings to honor the race. She wanted to raise money for bombing survivors. These new paintings are colorful and playful, showing runners and spectators along the 26.2-mile course from Hopkinton to Boston.\n\nOne painting, \"The Finish Line,\" was made on a foil blanket like the ones given to finishers to stay warm. Another painting uses a collage of Phelan’s race bib numbers as the background.\n\nHer paintings are being shown at Marathon Sports, a running store near Mile 23 of the course, during this year’s marathon on April 20.\n\n\"There’s so much happiness in her paintings,\" said Caitlin Marquis, a fellow runner and Boston resident. \"The city is determined to bring back the joy of the race, and her art fits perfectly with that.\"\n\nThe Boston Marathon has survived through tough times before. In 1918, during World War I, the race was replaced by a relay run by U.S. soldiers to promote patriotism.\n\nSome marathon fans feel that the \"Boston Strong\" movement, while important, is just one part of the race’s long history. \"The bombing was horrible, but over time, it will be remembered as one bad year in the marathon’s story,\" said Derderian, who is making a documentary about the race.\n\nPhelan, now living in Easthampton, hopes her art helps others remember the fun and energy of the marathon. \"The Boston Marathon is like a parade,\" she said. \"People are cheering, it’s loud, and there’s water being thrown at you.\"\n\n\"I hope it just goes back to normal. It was amazing before.\""

        "gpt": "WASHINGTON — Poverty looks different across the U.S. Some states, like Mississippi, have the highest poverty rates, while others, like Hawaii, Maryland, and Massachusetts, have much lower rates. But new data from the U.S. Census Bureau shows a surprising trend: even states with low overall poverty rates sometimes have a lot of people living in \"deep poverty.\" Deep poverty means earning less than half of the federal poverty level — about $12,000 a year for a family of four.\n\nThis problem is troubling for experts. It shows that even with programs to help, some people are still struggling a lot. The Census Bureau counts income before taxes and some benefits, but it doesn’t include food stamps or housing help, which many poor families rely on.\n\nTake Maryland, for example. In 2013, only 13.3% of Marylanders were at or near the poverty line — one of the lowest rates in the country. But nearly 38% of poor people in Maryland were in deep poverty, the highest percentage among all states. Some say this is because of poor areas in rural Maryland or struggling neighborhoods in Baltimore. In Baltimore, some areas have poverty rates over 90%, with high unemployment and many people unable to find jobs because of criminal records.\n\nBill McCarthy, from Catholic Charities of Baltimore, says traditional programs like food stamps don’t always work in these situations. His organization tries a different approach, offering job training, housing help, and health care all in one place. He says many of Baltimore’s poorest residents don’t even have an address to receive benefits.\n\nThis isn’t just happening in Maryland. In Hawaii, only 14.5% of people live at or near the poverty line, but 37% of poor residents are in deep poverty. Hawaii’s high cost of living makes it even harder for people to get by. Similarly, Massachusetts has a low overall poverty rate but still struggles with deep poverty, affecting 36% of its poor residents.\n\nNationally, about 34% of low-income Americans live in deep poverty. Vermont has the lowest rate at 26.3%. Young people are especially affected — half of those in deep poverty are under 25, and many are children. Programs like free school lunches and health care for kids help, but reaching childless adults is harder. Many safety-net programs, like tax credits or welfare, are tied to work or parenting.\n\nMost people in poverty do work, but those in deep poverty often don’t. A study found that three-fourths of deeply poor adults hadn’t worked at all in the previous year. Many face challenges like mental health issues, homelessness, or domestic violence, which make getting a job harder. In places like Washington, D.C., nearly 45% of poor residents live in deep poverty.\n\nAdvocates say it’s tough to help people climb out of deep poverty if basic needs like housing or mental health care aren’t addressed first. But others argue that work and self-sufficiency should be the focus. Conservatives point to job training and work requirements as the best ways to reduce poverty. Rachel Sheffield, from the Heritage Foundation, says the U.S. has a large welfare system, but it hasn’t led to more self-sufficiency. While living conditions have improved, she says, the goal of reducing poverty hasn’t been fully achieved."

        "gpt": "LONDON — In Britain, money seems to have a deep, serious voice, and some people think that's a problem.\n\nThree months ago, the Bank of England announced that Winston Churchill would be the new face on the 5-pound note. This was to honor him as a \"great British leader, speaker, and writer\" and a \"hero of the free world.\" Starting in 2016, Churchill’s face will appear on one of Britain’s most-used banknotes, worth about $7.50.\n\nBut this choice upset many women (and some men). They don’t dislike Churchill, the famous wartime leader, but his portrait will replace Elizabeth Fry, a 19th-century prison reformer. This means no historical women will appear on British money anymore—only Queen Elizabeth II, who is there because she was born into the royal family, not because of personal achievements.\n\nThis feels unfair in a country where women have made big contributions. Margaret Thatcher was one of the most important prime ministers in recent history. Queen Victoria ruled for nearly 64 years, and Queen Elizabeth II may soon break that record. The best-selling author of all time, Agatha Christie, is a British woman, as is J.K. Rowling, who wrote the \"Harry Potter\" series. Yet no historical women are on the money, and activist Caroline Criado-Perez thinks that’s wrong.\n\n“It’s another way women’s achievements are being erased,” she said. “We see money every day, so it sends a message that women haven’t done much.”\n\nQueen Elizabeth II’s face is on every coin and bill, but that’s only because she is queen. Her position isn’t something women can work hard to achieve—it depends on being born into the royal family. Criado-Perez pointed out, “If the queen had a brother, she wouldn’t be on the throne.”\n\nCriado-Perez, a freelance journalist, started a campaign to bring more gender balance to British money. She says laws against sexism support her cause. Over 30,000 people have signed her petition, and many female members of Parliament agree with her. \n\nRecently, protesters dressed as famous British women gathered outside the Bank of England. Some dressed as Emmeline Pankhurst, who fought for women’s right to vote. Others dressed as Boadicea, an ancient warrior-queen.\n\nThe controversy has caused problems for the Bank of England. Before stepping down as governor, Mervyn King hinted that Jane Austen, the famous author, might replace Charles Darwin on the 10-pound note. But that wasn’t enough to satisfy campaigners. The new governor, Mark Carney, has promised to make a decision soon.\n\nMember of Parliament Mary Macleod reminded Carney that women play a big role in British life and the economy. “It’s sad that on the money we earn and spend, there will be no historical women,” she said. “It leaves a gap where there once was inspiration.”\n\nCarney agreed that British money should show the diversity of great historical figures. Since 1970, famous Britons have been featured on banknotes. The first was William Shakespeare, and since then, 14 men have been chosen, including Charles Dickens and economist Adam Smith. Only two women—Elizabeth Fry and Florence Nightingale—have been included.\n\nThe process for choosing these figures is not open to the public. The bank says the person must be well-known, but many people wouldn’t recognize names like Matthew Boulton (an engineer) or John Houblon (the Bank of England’s first governor), both of whom have been on the 50-pound note.\n\nNot many people know much about Elizabeth Fry either, even Criado-Perez admits. But activists believe there are many other women who deserve to be on money. One suggestion is Rosalind Franklin, the scientist who helped discover DNA’s double-helix structure. Her male colleagues received most of the credit and the Nobel Prize, but she played a key role.\n\nCriado-Perez hopes the Bank of England won’t repeat this kind of sexism. She would love to see Jane Austen chosen. “People think of her as a quiet woman writing simple stories,” Criado-Perez said. “But her novels are very smart, complex, and full of satire. She’s a great example of what women can achieve.”"

Back then, Ma never thought he would want to be a farmer.\n\nNow, Ma dreams of starting a farm. But he doesn’t want to farm in China. In China, the word for \"farmer\" (nongmin) often means \"peasant.\" Many Chinese farmers are old, and they work on small, inefficient pieces of land.\n\nMa and others are looking for large areas of land with clean water in places like the United States, Chile, Brazil, Russia, Ukraine, and Australia. \"China’s economy is growing fast, and we need a lot of food,\" said Ma, who works as a farming analyst in Beijing. \"Farming abroad can make more sense financially.\"\n\nChina has 20% of the world’s people but only 9% of its farmland. This has always been a challenge. China also faces problems like drought, desertification, and pollution. A government study showed that 8 million acres of farmland in China are too polluted to use.\n\nFood safety scandals in China, like watermelons exploding from too much fertilizer or rice contaminated with cadmium, have made foreign-grown food more popular. Some Chinese companies are now farming abroad. For example, businessman Zhang Renwu owns two farms in Utah that grow alfalfa to feed dairy cows in China.\n\nChinese companies are buying or leasing farmland overseas. For instance, China’s largest pork company, Shuanghui, bought a U.S. company, Smithfield Foods, along with over 100,000 acres of farmland in the U.S. In Australia, a Chinese group purchased a massive cotton farm with the largest irrigation system in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nOther Chinese companies are growing fruits like blueberries and grapes in Chile or farming crops in Africa, such as rice and corn. Some of the food is sold locally, while some is shipped back to China.\n\nHowever, these investments are controversial. In China, people criticize the government for building too many apartments and malls on farmland. There are also debates about whether China should rely on foreign food. Historically, China’s leaders have promoted growing enough food within the country.\n\nAbroad, some countries worry about China’s growing presence in agriculture. For example, a Chinese company announced plans to farm a huge area in Ukraine, which caused alarm. Although the project was scaled back, it still raised concerns.\n\nIn Africa, critics say Chinese farming projects exploit the continent. In Zimbabwe, Chinese-owned farms have been called signs of \"colonialism.\" Many countries now restrict foreign ownership of farmland, so Chinese companies often lease land or promise to build infrastructure in exchange for farming rights.\n\nChina is not the biggest investor in global farming—countries like the U.S., Britain, and South Korea invest more. But China is catching up quickly. By 2012, Chinese investments in farming, fishing, and forestry abroad nearly doubled compared to two years earlier.\n\nOne reason for this push abroad is that farming in China is inefficient. Most Chinese farmers are over 50 years old and work on small plots of land. Ma believes the government should provide pensions so older farmers can retire, allowing larger and more efficient farms to take over.\n\nUntil then, Ma says, \"If you want to farm and make money, you need to go overseas.\""

The authors believe this challenges the government’s claim that more cases are only being found because of better health checks in the area.\n\nAfter the nuclear meltdown in March 2011, caused by a tsunami, about 370,000 children in Fukushima have had ultrasound tests to check their thyroids. By August, thyroid cancer was suspected or confirmed in 137 children, 25 more than the year before. In other places, only one or two children out of every million get thyroid cancer each year.\n\n“This is more than expected and is happening faster than expected,” said Toshihide Tsuda, the lead author of the study. He said the cancer rates in Fukushima are 20 to 50 times higher than normal.\n\nThe study, published online this week and soon to appear in the journal *Epidemiology*, uses data from tests done by Fukushima Medical University.\n\nUnderstanding the link between radiation and cancer is tricky. Scientists say it’s impossible to prove that a single cancer case is caused by radiation. Also, regular check-ups like those in Fukushima can find more tumors, which might make the numbers look higher due to what is called a \"screening effect.\"\n\nAfter the nuclear disaster, the government brought in Dr. Shunichi Yamashita, who said illnesses from radiation were unlikely. The thyroid tests were done just to be cautious, according to officials.\n\nHowever, Tsuda, a professor at Okayama University, said the latest findings raise doubts about the government’s explanation.\n\nThyroid cancer in children is a known result of radiation exposure, as seen after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. If caught early, it is rarely fatal, but patients need lifelong medication.\n\nScientists disagree about Tsuda’s conclusions. In the same journal, Scott Davis, a professor in Seattle, said Tsuda’s study lacks detailed data on individual radiation exposure. Davis supports the findings of groups like the World Health Organization, which predict no noticeable rise in cancer due to Fukushima radiation.\n\nBut David J. Brenner, a radiation expert at Columbia University, said the high cancer rates in Fukushima are real and not just caused by extra testing.\n\nDecisions about whether Fukushima radiation caused cancer will affect compensation and future policies. Many people have left areas the government says are safe, fearing health risks for their children.\n\nA zone about 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) around the nuclear plant is off-limits. The area is being cleaned, and the government hopes people will return. However, shutting down the plant fully will take decades.\n\nNoriko Matsumoto, a 53-year-old former nurse from Koriyama, just outside the no-go zone, fled to Tokyo with her 11-year-old daughter after the disaster. At first, she wasn’t worried, but she became scared when her daughter started having nosebleeds and rashes. \n\n“My daughter deserves to live without radiation,” Matsumoto said. “We can’t be sure radiation caused this, but I feel it’s the reason.”\n\nAndrew F. Olshan, a professor in North Carolina, said it’s hard to study what happens after a disaster. He said Tsuda’s study has limits, like not measuring individual radiation doses, but it is important to start more research, help governments plan, and raise public awareness."

        "gpt": "WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama has shown his love for music in many ways. He has sung Al Green's \"Let's Stay Together,\" led a church in singing \"Amazing Grace,\" and shared his Spotify playlist with songs by Stevie Wonder and Nina Simone. \n\nThe Obamas, Barack and Michelle, often feature R&B and soul artists like Patti LaBelle and B.B. King at White House events, such as state dinners, music celebrations, and the Easter Egg Roll.\n\nA PBS show called *In Performance at the White House* recently celebrated American music. The event included performances by Queen Latifah, Smokey Robinson, Usher, Trombone Shorty, and Esperanza Spalding. The episode will air on PBS on January 8.\n\nEsperanza Spalding, a Grammy-winning jazz artist, is also on Michelle Obama's Spotify playlist. She said the White House events send a message of inclusion and support for hardworking artists. Spalding, who teaches music and speaks out for human rights, said the Obamas show that even less-famous artists are important to American music.\n\nDalton Delan, who helps produce the PBS series, said artists are chosen based on the theme of each show, with approval from the White House. For example, White House social secretary Deesha Dyer helped pick MC Lyte, a pioneering female rapper.\n\nThe Obamas' music choices have shaped White House entertainment. Over the years, artists like Mary J. Blige, John Legend, and jazz musician Herbie Hancock have performed at state dinners. Pop star Beyoncé, a favorite of the Obamas, has performed at several big events, including an inaugural ball in 2009 and President Obama's second inauguration in 2013. Aretha Franklin, the \"Queen of Soul,\" sang at Obama's first inauguration in 2009 and performed at other White House events, including a gospel concert.\n\nDesiree Rogers, the first social secretary for the Obamas, said many factors influence the choice of entertainers for White House events. These include the type of event, the president and first lady's preferences, and suggestions from staff. For state dinners, the chosen entertainer often reflects the country being honored.\n\nLea Berman, who worked for President George W. Bush, said each administration has its own way of selecting performers. Sometimes the president or first lady suggests artists, and other times staff members provide options. She also noted that scheduling conflicts often limit choices, as popular entertainers are booked months ahead."

        "gpt": "HACKENSACK, N.J. — In New Jersey, the little brown bat population is shrinking fast because of a disease called white nose syndrome. Experts think they might even go extinct. But another bat species, the big brown bat, is growing in numbers. Since the disease first appeared in 2009, big brown bats in New Jersey have increased by up to 50%, scientists say.\n\nLittle brown bats have been hit hard. Their numbers have dropped by about 90% in six years. In 2009, there were about 30,000 little brown bats hibernating in New Jersey. Now, there are so few left that they might not recover. This is partly because female little brown bats only have one baby, or pup, each year.\n\nBig brown bats, however, are doing much better. Even though they can also get white nose syndrome, their biology and habits help them survive. They hibernate differently and can handle the disease better. Their numbers are growing so much that they are now taking over places where little brown bats used to live in the summer.\n\nThere is a small bit of hope for little brown bats. Some of them are returning to the same caves and mines to hibernate each year, like Hibernia Mine in Rockaway Township. Scientists think these bats may have some immunity to the disease or a special gene that helps them fight it.\n\n\"Right now, natural selection is helping the stronger bats survive,\" said DeeAnn Reeder, a bat expert at Bucknell University.\n\nWhite nose syndrome has killed about 7 million bats in the U.S. since it was first found in a cave in New York in 2006. It has now spread to 25 states. The disease is caused by a fungus that grows on bats while they hibernate. It makes them wake up and move around, using up their fat stores. Without enough fat, they starve and die.\n\nLosing bats is bad for people, too. Bats eat lots of insects that can harm crops or spread diseases like West Nile virus. Bats save U.S. farmers more than $4 billion each year by eating these insects.\n\nScientists in New Jersey have noticed that the survival rate of little brown bats is slowly improving. In 2010, 66% of hibernating bats survived. By last winter, the rate had increased to 71%. But this isn’t enough to replace the bats that have died. The population is still shrinking by 5% every year, said Brooke Maslo, a wildlife expert at Rutgers University. \"We may not have enough bats left to recover,\" she said.\n\nResearchers are working on ways to fight the disease. Some are testing bacteria that might kill the fungus. Others are looking at a different fungus that could compete with the white nose fungus. Another group is studying a substance called chitosan, made from the shells of crabs and shrimp, to see if it can help. But it’s still unclear how these treatments could be used safely in caves without harming other animals.\n\nEven if little brown bats recover, it could take hundreds of years for their numbers to go back to where they were before the disease, said Jeremy Coleman, who works with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nDifferent bat species are affected in different ways. Tricolored bats and northern long-eared bats have also suffered big losses. But Virginia big-eared bats seem unaffected, even in caves where other bats are dying. In New Jersey, big brown bats are thriving. This year, their numbers have grown by 14% at summer roosting sites. Since the disease appeared, their population has grown by about 50%, according to MacKenzie Hall, a biologist in New Jersey.\n\nBig brown bats survive better for several reasons. They are larger and lose less body heat during hibernation, so they can live off their fat stores more easily. They also hibernate alone or in small groups, which helps stop the disease from spreading. Plus, they hibernate for a shorter time than little brown bats. Unlike little brown bats, big brown bats can have two pups each year, which helps their population grow faster.\n\nBig brown bats are now moving into places where little brown bats used to live in the summer. \"Big brown bats are like super bats,\" said Reeder. \"They’re bigger and can act like bullies.\" Scientists wonder if the big brown bats are taking advantage of the little brown bats disappearing. With fewer little brown bats around, there might be more insects for big brown bats to eat. \"The data seems to show that,\" Reeder said."

        "gpt": "KIEV, Ukraine — Protests against Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich turned deadly on Tuesday. Protesters set fire to the ruling party's headquarters, and security forces attacked their camp in what officials called an \"anti-terror operation.\"\n\nThe Interior Ministry said nine people died, including two police officers, a government official, and six protesters. An opposition leader, Oleksandra Kuzhel, claimed the death toll had risen to 15 after police used stun grenades and water cannons. Other reports said as many as 19 people had died.\n\nEven the lowest numbers mark the deadliest day in the fight over Ukraine's future—whether it aligns more with Russia or the West.\n\nTV footage showed explosions lighting up the protesters' tent camp in Kiev's Independence Square, known as Maidan. Police in riot gear moved in after protesters ignored warnings to leave. Officers burned tents and threw tear gas into the crowd.\n\nThick smoke filled the air, lit by burning sandbags and debris. Despite the chaos and choking fumes, thousands of protesters stayed in the square, refusing to back down.\n\nProtests also spread to western Ukraine, where demonstrators attacked government offices.\n\nThe protests began in November after Yanukovich canceled a deal with the European Union to strengthen ties and instead chose closer economic ties with Russia. Many Ukrainians, especially in cities, want stronger connections with the West and have demanded Yanukovich resign.\n\nOpposition leaders said they asked for talks with the government to stop the violence and that officials agreed to meet on Wednesday. But by night, police were still burning tents and barricades.\n\nProtest leaders stayed strong. Opposition politician Arseny Yatsenyuk begged Yanukovich to stop the violence, warning that Ukraine could become \"a country covered with blood.\" Another leader, former boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, encouraged protesters to stand firm, calling the square \"an island of freedom.\"\n\nThe government blamed the opposition for the violence. Prosecutor General Viktor Pshonka said opposition leaders should be held responsible for the chaos, claiming they turned a peaceful rally into a violent clash.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. and U.N. urged both sides to calm down and talk. White House spokesman Jay Carney called on Yanukovich to restart talks with protesters. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also asked both sides to show restraint and have honest discussions.\n\nThe violence came after a brief calm over the weekend. The government had released 234 protesters and dropped charges against them, while protesters left Kiev City Hall and removed some barricades. But protesters still wanted Yanukovich to step down and reduce presidential powers.\n\nOn Tuesday, protesters marched to parliament, demanding a return to the 2004 constitution, which limits presidential authority. Tensions rose when Yanukovich's party delayed discussing these changes. Police tried to stop about 20,000 protesters from reaching parliament, but some broke through and attacked the ruling party's headquarters.\n\nProtesters threw stones at police, who responded with tear gas. Russian media, controlled by the Kremlin, blamed \"radicals\" for the violence, calling it a \"revolution\" and \"massive disorder.\"\n\nThe brief calm from the weekend ended as both sides feared the conflict over Ukraine's future was far from over.\n\nRussia has been giving Ukraine financial help to strengthen ties. On Monday, Russia said it would buy $2 billion more in Ukrainian bonds as part of a $15 billion aid package. Protesters see this as Russia trying to control Ukraine and keep it away from the European Union.\n\nRussia had already bought $3 billion in bonds but paused the aid after Ukraine's prime minister resigned last month. Protesters saw his resignation as a sign Yanukovich might agree to their demands for a new government.\n\nNow, protesters believe Russia is pressuring Yanukovich to stay in power and avoid early elections.\n\nRussia and the U.S. accuse each other of meddling in Ukraine's future. On Tuesday, a Russian official accused the U.S. of trying to control Ukraine's government. He claimed U.S. diplomats were secretly picking which opposition leaders should be in charge of a new government, based on a leaked phone call between two U.S. officials."

        "gpt": "BEIJING — If you want a full-time teaching job but only have a temporary one without health benefits, Luo Chunlei says you might need to give the school principal a box of mooncakes and some money in an envelope.\n\nHaving surgery? You may need to pay the surgeon extra—and don’t forget the anesthesiologist.\n\n\"I'm disgusted by it, but this is how things work here,\" said Luo, a 32-year-old math teacher turned activist. He is speaking out against the widespread corruption in Chinese society.\n\nGiving gifts has been part of Chinese culture for a long time. But now, these traditions are clashing with newer rules against corruption.\n\nThis year, the government is cracking down on fancy gifts. An editorial in *People's Daily* warned against giving luxury items like expensive wine, cigarettes, and large sums of money.\n\nThe stricter rules are part of President Xi Jinping's campaign to cut waste and corruption, which started after he became president in March. The crackdown began during the holiday season, starting with the Mid-Autumn Festival in September and running through the Lunar New Year in January.\n\nWang Qishan, the anti-corruption leader, said that expensive gifts have hurt the country’s culture of being simple and modest.\n\n\"China has always been about *guanxi*,\" or building connections, said Hu Xingdou, an economist in Beijing. \"Treating people to meals and giving gifts is deeply rooted in our culture, but it doesn’t go well with the rule of law.\"\n\nThe crackdown is forcing people to think about what is acceptable when it comes to gift-giving. For example, during the Mid-Autumn Festival, people often exchange mooncakes, which can cost up to $200 per box. Expensive cigarettes, red envelopes with cash (*hongbao*), and gift cards are also popular.\n\nParents in China often give gifts to teachers on Teachers' Day, hoping their children will get better grades. These gifts can range from small items to expensive pens or even luxury watches.\n\nAt the extreme end, corruption cases like that of Bo Xilai, a former government official, highlight the problem. Bo was sentenced to life in prison after it was revealed he accepted bribes, including a $3 million villa in France.\n\nThe government recently banned the use of public money to buy mooncakes, as officials had been using them to bribe their superiors. This gift-giving culture is partly driven by fierce competition for jobs, education, and healthcare.\n\nLuo shared that his family once paid $16,000 in cash to a public hospital for his grandfather’s surgery, even though it was supposed to be covered by insurance. In his hometown, parents pay thousands of dollars to transfer their children to better schools.\n\nThere is no official movement against gift-giving, but it’s a hot topic on the internet. Both givers and receivers feel conflicted. A teacher once wrote online that refusing gifts from parents feels like losing respect. But accepting gifts can be risky too. In one case, a doctor who refused a cash gift was attacked by the family offering it.\n\nCorruption is also visible in government. Activists have exposed officials with luxury watches they shouldn’t afford on their salaries. One official nicknamed \"Brother Watch\" was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being caught with a $62,000 watch.\n\nLuxury store sales in Beijing spike in March, as government officials buy gifts for their superiors during the National People's Congress. Although officials aren’t supposed to accept gifts worth more than $820, the rule is often ignored.\n\nThe issue of family members accepting gifts also causes confusion. In Bo Xilai’s case, his wife and son accepted millions of dollars in gifts, including the French villa. Bo claimed he didn’t know about it, but the court didn’t believe him.\n\nSome experts argue that all gift-giving should be banned to end corruption. \"In China, gifts are not always about direct favors. They’re about building relationships,\" said Ira Belkin, a law expert.\n\nPresident Xi’s anti-corruption campaign isn’t the first of its kind. According to Qiao Xinsheng, a professor of law, every new leader launches a crackdown on corruption. However, critics wonder if this campaign is more about targeting Xi’s political rivals.\n\nForeign companies like GlaxoSmithKline and Danone have also been accused of bribery in China, though Chinese companies are guilty of similar practices. Economist Hu Xingdou says anti-corruption efforts in China are selective. \"If we held every official to the same standard, there would be no officials left,\" he said."

        "gpt": "The Cuban crocodile, one of the rarest crocodiles in the world, is in danger of disappearing because it is mixing with another species, the American crocodile. These two species are having babies together, called hybrids. Each time this happens, part of the Cuban crocodile's unique genes gets replaced by genes from the American crocodile. Over time, more Cuban crocodile genes are lost, and the species could eventually vanish.\n\nScientists knew these two crocodile species were mating in the wild, but a new study showed just how often this happens. The study, published on October 22 in the journal *Heredity*, looked at the genetics of crocodiles in Cuba. Researchers studied crocodile scales from 227 wild crocodiles and 137 crocodiles from a breeding farm in the Zapata Swamp. They found that 49.1% of the wild crocodiles were hybrids, while only 16.1% of the farm crocodiles had mixed genes. The lower number in the farm crocodiles is because, in 1974, the breeding program decided to raise only Cuban crocodiles.\n\nThe Cuban crocodile is critically endangered, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It used to live all over Cuba, but hunting in the 1800s caused its population to shrink. Now, only about 4,000 Cuban crocodiles are left, and they face a new threat: losing their unique genes because of hybridization with the American crocodile. This loss of genes could make it harder for Cuban crocodiles to survive changes in their environment. Scientists say the Cuban crocodile is special because of its unique looks, behavior, and role in nature, and it should be protected.\n\nThe mixing of genes also challenges the idea of what makes a species. A species is usually defined as a group of animals that can mate with each other but not with other groups. The Cuban and American crocodiles mating breaks this rule.\n\nThe next question for scientists is whether this hybridization is natural or caused by humans. \"It seems to be partly natural but also increased by human activities,\" says Yoamel Milián-García, a researcher from the University of Havana. Changes to habitats and illegal hunting might be forcing the two species to live closer together, making it easier for them to mate.\n\nThe situation is even more complicated because American crocodiles in Cuba are genetically closer to Cuban crocodiles than to other American crocodiles found in places like mainland North America. This suggests that Cuban and American crocodiles started sharing genes more than 200,000 years ago. Scientists now think there are three distinct genetic groups, not just two.\n\n\"We’re not sure if this is from ancient mixing or something more complex,\" says George Amato, a scientist from the American Museum of Natural History. \"But we do know that the current mixing is a serious threat to the Cuban crocodile as a separate species.\" Amato was not involved in the study but is familiar with the research.\n\nThere is some hope, though. Among the captive Cuban crocodiles, about 30% have unique genes not found in the rest of the group. These special crocodiles could help scientists protect the Cuban crocodile's genetic diversity. Researchers plan to use this information to create Cuba's first scientific plan for managing crocodiles and ensuring their survival."

Lovato even sang at a concert for Clinton at the University of Iowa to try to win over younger voters. \n\nClinton is hoping these events will make her more popular with college students. But many young voters still prefer her 74-year-old rival, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. \n\n\"Bernie seems cooler to me,\" said Alex Bare, a 19-year-old student at the University of Iowa. Alex plans to vote for Sanders but went to the free concert anyway. \"He doesn’t take money from big groups, and that’s really bold. That makes him cool.\"\n\nClinton and Sanders are in a close race for the Democratic nomination. Clinton is leading nationally, but Sanders is more popular with young voters. A recent poll showed that 59% of Democratic voters under 45 in Iowa support Sanders, while only 27% support Clinton. Another poll showed Sanders had 60% of voters under 45 across the country, compared to Clinton’s 31%.\n\n\"Bernie has the hipster vote,\" said Erin Kelleher, a 26-year-old graduate student, who is deciding between Clinton and Sanders. But she said the Lovato concert didn’t change her decision because she doesn’t care about celebrities.\n\nSanders also has some celebrity supporters, like actress Susan Sarandon and hip-hop artist Killer Mike. But Sanders doesn’t need them to draw big crowds of students. Many young people are coming to his rallies because they like his ideas, such as free tuition at public colleges. They also like that he doesn’t take money from political action committees (PACs). His casual style and \"grumpy grandpa\" personality also appeal to them.\n\nMost of all, students love his slogan, \"Feel the Bern.\" Ian Wold, a 20-year-old student, said, \"Bernie gets me excited.\"\n\nThe fight for young voters reminds people of the 2008 election, when Clinton lost the youth vote to Barack Obama. Young voters are less likely to vote, but they can make a big difference in a close race. Their energy also makes a campaign look strong.\n\nOn Thursday, about 1,700 students came to see Lovato and Clinton. Lovato performed her hit song \"Confident\" and said, \"I don’t think there’s a woman more confident than Hillary Clinton.\" Afterward, Clinton spoke for five minutes, calling Lovato \"extraordinary\" and asking students to vote for her. She promised to fight for equal rights and stand up to big corporations.\n\nEarlier that day, Clinton held a smaller event at Simpson College for about 500 people, most of whom were older. Some young people, like Hannah Friesen, said Sanders' visit to campus brought out more students, some even making their own shirts to show support.\n\nNot all students prefer Sanders. Austin Graber, 22, said he thinks Clinton is \"the most qualified.\" Lauren Ellbogen, 18, is helping Clinton’s campaign and said she doesn’t think Sanders’ ideas are realistic.\n\nOver the weekend, Sanders had huge crowds at colleges in Iowa. More than 2,000 people came to see him at Luther College on Sunday. Students, wearing \"Feel the Bern\" shirts, cheered and shouted when Sanders talked about free college and not taking PAC money. They chanted, \"Bernie, Bernie, Bernie,\" and some yelled, \"We love you Bernie.\"\n\nClinton has been using celebrities to help her campaign for months. Katy Perry performed at a rally in October, wearing an American flag cape and a Clinton pin. Lena Dunham has also visited several states to support Clinton. \n\nSome students think the Lovato concert was a good idea, but not everyone was impressed. Jen Moulton, 18, who leans toward Sanders, said the concert was \"kind of cool, but it feels like she’s trying too hard.\""

        "gpt": "CHICAGO — A man with a powerful rifle started shooting at a basketball game in a Chicago neighborhood on Thursday night. He hurt 13 people, including a 3-year-old boy, and brought attention again to the city’s problem with gun violence.\n\nThis shooting made the mayor, Rahm Emanuel, end his trip on the East Coast and return to Chicago. Even before he arrived, news reports were asking if this showed the city had become more dangerous because of the type of gun used and the number of victims.\n\nPolice found shell casings from a gun like an AK-47 at the basketball court in Cornell Square Park, in an area called Back of the Yards. Guns like this are not usually used in gang violence in Chicago. Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy said at a press conference, \"It’s a miracle no one died. Illegal guns are the problem, and a military weapon on Chicago streets is unacceptable.\"\n\nThe park is in an area with gangs but not in a high-crime zone with extra police. Officers only patrol the park sometimes, and there is a curfew at 11 p.m. The shooting happened about 45 minutes before the park closed. At least one shooter walked to the basketball court and started firing. The 13 victims included players and people watching the game. Everyone is expected to survive.\n\nKevin Gordon, 31, was shot in the backside while talking to his cousin. “It felt like the longest seconds of my life,” he said. “I couldn’t run, then it stopped. I looked around, and it seemed like everyone was hit.”\n\nThree-year-old Deonta Howard was shot near his ear, and the bullet went out through his cheek. His family said he will need surgery. His mother, Shamarah Leggett, said, \"They shot my baby with a gun bigger than him. This has to stop.\" The boy’s uncle was also shot and killed in Chicago earlier this month.\n\nPolice think the shooting happened because of a fight between two gangs, the Black P. Stones and the Gangster Disciples. The park does not belong to either gang. Police don’t know if the victims were the targets. No arrests have been made yet, and police are checking nearby cameras. Officials think there may have been up to three shooters.\n\nWhen paramedics arrived, they found over a dozen injured people lying on the basketball court. One person was near a fallen bike, and white gym shoes were left near the court. Ambulances came for about 30 minutes to take the injured, including a 15-year-old boy and a 17-year-old girl, to hospitals. Around 60 police officers came to the park to investigate.\n\nMario Campbell, 25, was shot three times in the stomach. His mother, Diane Cade, said he had been worried about gang fights that week and stayed home most of the time. He only went to the park to watch the basketball game. \"It’s hard for a young man here,\" Cade said. \"No matter how much you try to do better, it’s tough.\"\n\nSuperintendent McCarthy didn’t say how the shooting affects Chicago’s image or police work. “Every shooting is a setback,” he said. “But this is not just a Chicago problem.”\n\nThe shooting caused Mayor Emanuel to cancel a meeting in Washington, D.C., and return to Chicago. He visited Deonta’s mother at the hospital, where the boy was in critical condition and getting ready for surgery. Later, the mayor joined a prayer meeting and told people to follow a \"moral code.\" He said, \"The parks, streets, and homes in Chicago belong to families. Go out and enjoy our city.\"\n\nThis shooting happened just after the FBI shared data showing Chicago had more murders than New York in 2012. Superintendent McCarthy said the numbers were already known and don’t show the progress made, as the murder rate dropped 20% in the past year.\n\nBut Alderman Willie Cochran, a retired police officer, said the shooting hurts the city’s efforts to fight crime. “It’s a setback,” he said. “We’ve worked hard to reduce crime, but people’s fear of crime is still very strong.”"

        "gpt": "HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. — Last year, Cassidy Campbell thought about running for homecoming queen but brushed it off as a joke. Now, as a high school senior, she sees it as a way to make a statement.\n\n\"I'm a girl every day now,\" Cassidy said at her home in Huntington Beach.\n\nCassidy, who is transgender, started a social media campaign to win the homecoming crown at Marina High School. She hopes to challenge old ideas about gender and show others that being yourself is important.\n\n\"If I win, it means my school sees me as the girl I’ve always felt I was,\" Cassidy said.\n\nCassidy was born male but never felt like a boy. She loved dolls and dresses as a child and felt upset when her mom cut her hair or made her wear boy clothes. In middle school, she told classmates she was gay because saying she was transgender made her feel like an outsider. \n\nIn high school, Cassidy found inspiration from YouTube videos of transgender women. \"They were unique and beautiful,\" she said. On Halloween during her sophomore year, she dressed as a girl for the first time. After that, she wore skirts and dresses to school occasionally but still felt like she wasn’t fully herself.\n\nEventually, Cassidy decided to make a big change. Without telling her mom, she bought hormone blockers online. A few months ago, she told her mom the truth. Cassidy cried as she admitted, \"I’m taking hormone blockers and will start estrogen soon, with or without your permission.\" Her mom, Christine, agreed to support her. Now, Cassidy takes medication prescribed by a doctor. \n\nThe physical changes have helped, but Cassidy says the biggest change is how she feels inside. \"Everything about me changed,\" she said.\n\nOn Friday, Marina High will hold a pep rally to narrow the 10 homecoming queen candidates down to five. Later, at the football game, the winner will be crowned. Cassidy’s mom will walk her onto the field if she makes it to the final round. \n\nCassidy plans to wear a black leather and chiffon dress to the game and a patterned dress to the homecoming dance. Like many teens, she spends time chatting about Britney Spears and trying on outfits. But she also worries about her health and staying safe as a transgender girl. \n\n\"It’s worth it,\" Cassidy said. \"I’d rather live as the person I want to be than as someone I’m not.\"\n\nDoctors warn of risks like blood clots or liver damage with hormone treatment, but they also say it’s necessary for many transgender teens. \"This isn’t a choice; it’s a medical need,\" said Dr. Johanna Olson, a specialist in transgender youth health.\n\nCassidy’s mom admits it hasn’t been easy. \"My religion says it’s wrong,\" she said. \"But love means letting her be who she wants to be.\"\n\nThe school has supported Cassidy’s decision. Principal Paul Morrow said, \"If Marina High makes news this homecoming, we’re proud it’s about equality and respect.\"\n\nCassidy is hopeful about winning. \"This isn’t just about me,\" she said. \"It’s for all the kids who can’t be themselves.\"\n\n---\n\nSANTA ANA, Calif. — On Friday night, Cassidy Lynn Campbell was crowned homecoming queen at Marina High School. She broke down in tears as her classmates cheered her name and rushed to hug her.\n\nCassidy, who was born male, has been living as a girl after starting hormone blockers and estrogen therapy. She decided to run for homecoming queen to make a statement about acceptance.\n\n\"If I win, it means the school sees me as the girl I’ve always been,\" she said before the event. \"But now I see it’s bigger than me.

During halftime at the football game, balloons were released to reveal the winner—white for princesses and yellow and blue for the queen.

        "gpt": "People around the world speak many languages, but one word might connect us all: \"Huh?\"  \n\nA new study looked at 10 different languages from cities and remote villages on five continents. Researchers recorded nearly 200 casual conversations and found that every language had a version of \"Huh?\" that sounded very similar.  \n\nWhile \"Huh?\" might seem unimportant, it plays a key role in fixing broken conversations. When someone doesn’t hear or understand something, they can say \"Huh?\" to ask the speaker to repeat it.  \n\nA team from the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in the Netherlands studied this word. They wanted to show that \"Huh?\" is a real word, even if it’s a simple one. They also wanted to see if other languages had a similar word.  \n\nThe problem is, \"Huh?\" is so common that it’s often ignored in studies about language. So, the researchers traveled to remote villages in places like Ecuador, Laos, Ghana, and Australia. They spent weeks building trust with locals to record natural conversations. They also visited homes in Italy, Russia, and Taiwan, as well as labs in Spain and the Netherlands.  \n\nThe languages they studied included Cha’palaa, Dutch, Icelandic, Italian, Lao, Mandarin Chinese, Murriny Patha, Russian, Siwu, and Spanish. English wasn’t part of the study.  \n\nIn all these languages, \"Huh?\" sounded very similar. It was always one syllable, often using a sound like \"ah\" or \"eh.\" Sometimes it started with a consonant, like the \"H\" in English \"Huh?\" or the Dutch \"Heh?\" But across all the languages, the word was simple and easy to say.  \n\nThe scientists said \"Huh?\" is a real word because it has to be learned and follows the rules of each language. For example, English speakers raise their voice at the end of a question, so their \"Huh?\" sounds like a question too. Icelandic speakers lower their tone when asking questions, so their \"Ha?\" sounds different.  \n\nThis similarity is surprising. Most words with the same meaning sound very different in different languages. So why does \"Huh?\" sound alike everywhere?  \n\nThe researchers believe it’s because \"Huh?\" solves the same problem in every language: fixing a broken conversation. The sound is quick and easy to make, requiring little effort from the mouth. This makes it perfect for asking someone to repeat themselves.  \n\nThe scientists compared this to \"convergent evolution\" in biology. For example, sharks and dolphins look alike because they both need to swim well, even though they come from different species. In the same way, \"Huh?\" seems to have developed in many languages because it’s so useful.  \n\nExperts think \"Huh?\" was invented independently many times across the world. That’s why it feels like a universal word."

        "gpt": "In the summer of 1914, as World War I began in Europe, writer Henry James felt that something precious had been lost forever. He wrote to a friend, saying the war was a \"black tragedy\" and that it destroyed his belief in the progress of civilization. James died in 1916, before the war ended, unable to imagine the full destruction it caused. Millions of people died, empires fell, and old ways of thinking were shattered. Many survivors wondered how the world had been dragged into such a terrible war.\n\nWorld War I, which began 100 years ago, changed everything. It destroyed the world that existed before it and deeply affected writers, artists, and musicians. The war inspired a new style called modernism, which questioned old ideas and traditions. \n\nIn the 1800s, people believed in progress and that technology would make life better. But World War I turned that idea upside down. The war used deadly new technology, like chemical weapons and machines, to kill on a massive scale. This horror was reflected in the art and stories created during and after the war. Artists showed feelings of chaos, brokenness, and despair.\n\nThe war also changed how people thought about war itself. For centuries, war was often seen as a noble and necessary act. But World War I made many people, including writers and poets, reject this idea. Poet Wilfred Owen wrote about the horrors of war in his famous poem \"Dulce et Decorum Est.\" He described the brutal suffering of soldiers and called the idea that it is \"sweet and proper to die for your country\" a lie.\n\nAt first, some poets and writers supported the war. For example, Carl Sandburg celebrated soldiers going to fight. Other well-known writers, like Arthur Conan Doyle, wrote to cheer on the troops. But as the war dragged on, the mood changed. Artists like John Singer Sargent painted haunting images of the war's cruelty. Sargent’s famous painting \"Gassed\" shows soldiers blinded by poison gas, stumbling in a line.\n\nThe war left many soldiers broken, both physically and emotionally. They came back home as part of what Gertrude Stein called the \"lost generation.\" Writers like Ernest Hemingway and Erich Maria Remarque captured this feeling in their books. Hemingway’s *A Farewell to Arms* and Remarque’s *All Quiet on the Western Front* showed how war stripped away humanity and left soldiers disillusioned.\n\nWorld War I also ended the old way of fighting wars, which followed strict rules and codes of honor. The movie *La Grande Illusion* by Jean Renoir highlights how the war destroyed the old ideas of hierarchy and respect between soldiers. Instead, war became about mass killing, with no room for honor or fairness.\n\nThe chaos and destruction of World War I inspired modernist artists like James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, and Marcel Duchamp to break traditional rules in their work. They created new, experimental styles of writing, painting, and music to reflect the shattered world around them. Their art often felt fragmented and strange, just like the war itself.\n\nOne of the war’s most lasting images wasn’t about its horrors but about inspiring people to join the fight. In 1917, artist James Montgomery Flagg drew the famous \"Uncle Sam\" poster with the words \"I Want YOU for U.S. Army.\" This poster became one of the most recognized symbols of the war.\n\nWorld War I forever changed how people saw the world, each other, and the idea of war itself. It left a lasting mark on art, literature, and history."

        "gpt": "In October, French police stopped a school trip to take away a 15-year-old girl named Leonarda Dibrani. Her family had asked to stay in France, but the government said no. The police didn’t wait for school to end. They took her off the bus with her classmates and sent her to Kosovo, a country she had never lived in.\n\nMany people think this happened because Leonarda is Romani, also called Roma. Some people use the word \"Gypsy,\" but it is seen as insulting. The Roma are one of the most mistreated groups in Europe. They face a lot of unfairness in jobs, schools, and healthcare. A group called Oxfam said they are the poorest and most discriminated group in Europe.\n\nAfter Leonarda was sent away, many students in France protested to bring her back. But soon, another story took over the news. In Greece, police found a blonde girl living with a Roma family. People thought she might have been kidnapped. A Greek charity said this made them suspect the Roma of stealing children. However, there is no proof that the Roma kidnap children. This idea has been around for centuries but is based on old stories, not facts.\n\nA lawyer in Italy, Claudia Tavani, said the economic problems in Europe have made life harder for the Roma. When times get tough, people look for someone to blame. In countries like Italy and Greece, politicians often blame the Roma to gain votes. They call them thieves and troublemakers.\n\nThe Roma face discrimination in many places. In Slovakia, walls are built around Roma areas. In the Czech Republic, neo-Nazis protest against them. In Norway, laws were made to stop Roma from camping in public areas. In Romania, a political group even offered money to Roma women to stop having children. In France, a politician said not enough Roma were killed during World War II. This shows how much hate the Roma still face today.\n\nDuring the Holocaust, Germany killed hundreds of thousands of Roma. Even after that, the hatred didn’t go away. In Germany, some people still say the Roma don’t contribute to society. A far-right group used the slogan, “Money for Grandma, not Gypsies,” to spread hate.\n\nRomani Rose, a Roma leader in Germany, said the Roma still face racism and poverty. Many Roma live in overcrowded apartments and are charged too much for rent. This leads to fights with neighbors and brings back old stereotypes.\n\nNot everyone sees the Roma in a negative way. In Berlin, Cordula Simon works to help Roma families. She believes the Roma are just regular people, not criminals or troublemakers. Her plan is simple: help Roma children go to school, find homes for families, and help adults get jobs. She says it’s important not to force Roma into separate neighborhoods, which only creates more problems.\n\nSimon said Roma children are eager to learn, even if they start school far behind. Teachers in her area feel inspired by how hard these children work. Many Roma parents make big sacrifices to give their kids a better future.\n\nOne Roma man, Mitek, left Bulgaria to find work in Berlin. He had to leave his family behind. For six months, he has lived in an abandoned factory, collecting bottles to earn money. His home is a small hut made of scrap wood. Despite his hard life, Mitek still hopes to find a job and bring his family to live with him. \"My life will get better soon,\" he said."

But instead of turning on the TV, they grab their phones and open YouTube to watch videos before school. \n\nThis is the future of TV watching. Kids are moving away from cable and even from using traditional TVs. Many now watch videos on phones and tablets instead. YouTube and Netflix are their favorite platforms.\n\nTerence Burke, a researcher at KidSay, says kids are spending less time watching cable channels like Disney and Nickelodeon. Instead, they prefer digital videos on their devices. A study by Smarty Pants found that most kids, even as young as 6, use YouTube. Many also use Netflix, which offers shows they enjoy.\n\nYouTube is popular because it has endless videos that are funny, educational, or entertaining. Netflix is great for older kids who like shows with ongoing stories. Both platforms are easy to use on phones and tablets, which kids love.\n\nTo attract kids and families, platforms like YouTube, Netflix, and Amazon have created special kid-friendly sections. But older kids often skip those and use the regular versions. Many kids under 13 are already using YouTube, even though it’s meant for older users. YouTube also offers a paid version, YouTube Red, with no ads and extra features, which may appeal to kids as they grow.\n\nYouTube is the most-used app for kids ages 8 to 11, according to KidSay. Boys love channels like \"JackSepticEye\" and \"PewDiePie,\" which feature video game commentary. Girls enjoy different content, such as nail painting tutorials, cooking challenges, and family vlogs like \"Shaytards\" and \"Bratayleys.\" These vlogs feel more personal than regular TV shows.\n\nSmartphones are becoming more common among kids. About 73% of teens have smartphones, and many younger kids also have their own phones or tablets. This access to devices makes it easy for them to watch YouTube and Netflix anytime, anywhere.\n\nYouTube is often the first platform kids use to explore media. They watch unboxing videos, peer-made content, and even use it for homework help. Netflix is also popular because parents see it as safe and family-friendly.\n\nUnlike adults, who may cancel cable to save money, kids simply prefer watching on their phones and tablets. They like the control and freedom these devices give them. TV watching on traditional sets has dropped, with only 68% of kids using TVs in 2015, down from 73% the year before.\n\nMany families, like the Philips and Kuder households, notice their kids rarely use the TV. Instead, they watch YouTube or Netflix on their personal devices. Some kids even use multiple devices at once, like watching YouTube on a tablet while playing a game on a computer.\n\nThanks to platforms like YouTube and Netflix, kids no longer see TV as something you sit and watch on a big screen. They want entertainment that is interactive, flexible, and available wherever they are."

        "gpt": "WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama urged Congress to raise wages and protect programs that help people in need. On Wednesday, he spoke about fixing unfair money gaps that keep children stuck in poverty. \"This should upset all of us,\" he said. \"We are better than this.\"\n\nObama focused on money problems that many Americans worry about. He said it’s getting harder for people to move up in life because income gaps are growing. He called it \"the biggest challenge of our time.\"\n\n\"The deal that kept our economy fair is falling apart,\" Obama said. He spoke at a community center near the White House, located in one of Washington’s poorest areas.\n\nObama didn’t announce new plans but asked Congress to act on current ideas to help the economy. He also shared his vision for reducing money inequality. With people doubting how well he’s handling the economy, the speech outlined his goals for the next three years.\n\nHowever, by mentioning past plans that failed in a divided government, Obama showed the difficulties he has faced in fixing these problems.\n\nHe admitted his team made mistakes with the health care website, which was supposed to make buying insurance easy. He also blamed Republicans for shutting down the government, calling it \"reckless.\"\n\n\"Nobody has done a great job these past months,\" Obama said. \"So it’s no surprise people are frustrated with Washington.\" He added that many Americans are struggling to pay bills, even when they work hard.\n\nObama’s speech came as more people are talking about money inequality. Pope Francis has spoken about the issue, and fast-food workers in the U.S. have protested for better pay. Obama mentioned the pope, past presidents, and his own experience growing up with a struggling mom.\n\nHe pointed out that a child born into a poor family in the U.S. has less than a 5% chance of becoming rich. That child is 10 times more likely to stay poor, which is worse than in countries like Canada, Germany, and France.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner blamed Democrats and Obama for not passing job-related bills. He said Republicans in the House approved bills to help the economy, but Democrats in the Senate blocked them. \"The Senate and the president are stopping progress,\" Boehner said.\n\nObama admitted that \"the big problem\" is the political gridlock in Congress. Still, he defended the health care law, saying it’s already helping families by giving more people insurance and lowering health care costs.\n\nObama asked Congress to raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 an hour over three steps. A bill by Senator Tom Harkin would also tie future wage increases to the cost of living.\n\nThe Senate will likely focus on other issues in December, so a vote on the wage increase is not expected soon. Even when debated, the plan may not get enough votes to pass because many Republicans oppose it.\n\nObama also asked Congress to extend unemployment benefits for 1.3 million people who have been out of work for a long time. These benefits are set to end three days after Christmas. Since 2009, extra weeks of benefits have been approved each year. But Republican lawmaker Tom Cole said his party does not support another extension."

They are trying to create body parts that can be used for medical treatments.\n\nThis is not the only lab in the world working on growing organs. But London’s work got attention on Tuesday when Mayor Boris Johnson announced a plan to bring more labs to the area for advanced health and science research.\n\nSo far, only a few patients have received these lab-made body parts, like tear ducts, blood vessels, and windpipes. But scientists hope they will soon be able to make more, including the world’s first nose made partly from stem cells.\n\n\"It’s like baking a cake,\" said Alexander Seifalian from University College London, who leads the project. \"We just use a different kind of oven.\"\n\nThe British government has spent nearly 4 million pounds ($6.7 million) to encourage research in the London-Oxford-Cambridge area. They want companies to work together to create new health and science solutions. A big research center will open in London next year.\n\nUniversity College London is part of this effort. In his lab, Seifalian showed a machine that makes molds for body parts using a special material. Last year, his team used this material to make a nose for a man who lost his to cancer. They used salt and sugar to make the mold feel like a real nose. Then, they grew the man’s stem cells in the lab and added them to the nose. The nose was implanted into the man’s arm first to let skin grow over it.\n\nThe team is now waiting for permission to move the nose to the man’s face, but they don’t know when this will happen.\n\nSeifalian’s special material for making body parts is patented. He has also applied for patents for blood vessels, tear ducts, and windpipes. His team is working on other parts, like arteries and ears. They will start a trial later this year in India and London to test lab-made ears for people born without them.\n\n\"Ears are harder to make than noses because they have more details, and the skin shows every part of the structure,\" said Dr. Michelle Griffin, a plastic surgeon in Seifalian’s lab. She explained that children needing new ears currently have to go through a painful procedure to take cartilage from their ribs. In the future, they hope to create a fully synthetic face, but first, they need to make sure the material won’t cause problems under the skin.\n\nScientists say simpler parts like noses and ears must be perfected before moving on to more complex organs like kidneys, lungs, or livers. \"What Seifalian has done is amazing,\" said Eileen Gentleman, a stem cell expert at King’s College London. \"He’s made structures that work for his patients, like windpipes and tear ducts.\"\n\nSome scientists believe lab-made organs will soon be widely available. \"I’m sure engineered organs will be on the market soon,\" said Suchitra Sumitran-Holgersson, a professor in Sweden. She has used lab-made blood vessels in a few patients and hopes to offer them to more people soon.\n\nSeifalian thinks lab-made organs could one day be affordable, costing only a few hundred dollars. \"If people don’t mind, we could make noses in different sizes, and surgeons could pick one to fit the patient,\" he said. \"People think noses are unique, but we might be able to mass-produce them like products in a factory.\""

The plan involves both government money and help from private companies. Big companies like Apple, AT&T, Microsoft, Sprint, and Verizon are donating about $750 million in products and services to help students get online.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is also adding $2 billion to the project. Altogether, this funding will help about 20 million students get Internet access in schools and libraries over the next two years. This timeline is faster than Obama first expected when he introduced the plan last year.\n\nOriginally, officials thought the FCC would need a long time to approve the $2 billion. But recently, the FCC found a way to release the money faster, skipping a formal vote.\n\nObama pointed out that this progress didn't require a vote from Congress and didn’t cost taxpayers extra money. However, he said he will still ask Congress for more help.\n\nHe plans to ask lawmakers to fund training for teachers so they can use the new technology effectively. Obama also called on business leaders to continue supporting the project and to encourage Congress to take action.\n\n\"I'm asking every business leader to join us,\" Obama said, \"so we can give every young person a better chance to succeed.\""

They showed support for protests against the government in Venezuela.\n\nThe event, called the S.O.S. Venezuela rally, took place at J.C. Bermudez Park. It was one of more than 155 similar rallies held worldwide.\n\nMany people held signs asking for help for Venezuela. They blamed President Nicolas Maduro for problems like crime, food shortages, and lack of freedom. They also asked other countries to step in and help.\n\n\"I’m here because we’re tired of this government,\" said Maria Archer, a Venezuelan who has lived in the U.S. for 15 years. \"The government stops people from speaking freely, causes food shortages, and allows violence. We need help to remove this government.\"\n\nBlanca Aleman, 44, from Weston, Florida, said, \"I was born and raised in Venezuela. I love my country and want my kids to know the Venezuela I grew up in, not what it has become.\"\n\nAleman’s parents and brother still live in Venezuela. She said her brother is very worried. \"He has kids in college and just wants to leave.\"\n\nThe rally, which police said had about 4,000 people, was organized by groups like Un Mundo Sin Mordaza (A World Without Censorship). \n\nCarlos Tagliafica, a volunteer, said the rallies were meant to support students in Venezuela who are leading protests. \"This is all for the students,\" he said.\n\nIn Venezuela, protests over the past two weeks have turned violent. At least 10 people have died since February 12. On Saturday, more protests happened in Caracas, the capital. Some say these are the biggest protests since Maduro became president after Hugo Chavez died last year.\n\nOpposition leader Leopoldo Lopez has been jailed, accused of causing violence. This has upset many and drawn criticism from human rights groups. The Human Rights Foundation calls Lopez a \"prisoner of conscience.\"\n\nIn Doral, most rally participants wore white. They prayed, sang, chanted, and held a moment of silence.\n\nVeronica Arocha, a 31-year-old from Caracas now living in Fort Lauderdale, said the situation in Venezuela is terrible. She stays in touch with her family through WhatsApp. \"There are shortages of food and medicine,\" she said. \"My brother, who has diabetes, can’t find insulin.\"\n\nAlthough most people at the rally were Venezuelan, others from Latin America joined too. Berardo Barrero, a Cuban, said, \"You have to fight for freedom in all countries.\" \n\nRamon Saul Sanchez, a Cuban exile and leader of the Democracy Movement, also attended. He said he supports Venezuelans and criticized Cuban military advisers believed to be helping the Venezuelan government. \"The Cubans harming Venezuela do not represent the Cuban people,\" Sanchez said.\n\nPeople from Argentina, Peru, Nicaragua, and other countries also attended. Andrea Taglia Ferro, 29, from Venezuela, said she was happy to see the support. \"Our situation is touching others,\" she said. She believes social media, like Facebook, has helped spread awareness.\n\nMost protesters agreed that Venezuela needs new leadership. \"The country is sinking,\" said Enrique Chacon, 45, from San Cristobal, Venezuela. \"They need to let others manage the country.

Her little brother holds the first-aid kit. Their mom, Erika, carries a cooler, blanket, and chair.\n\nMost weekdays, they spend five hours traveling back and forth — by train, bus, and walking — from Boyle Heights to Pasadena, California. Luisa, who is 11, plays for one of the best soccer teams in the state. She dreams of becoming a professional soccer player.\n\nBut their hard work isn’t just about soccer. It’s about a better future.\n\nIn Pasadena, Luisa plays with kids whose parents are doctors, lawyers, and professors. Her teammates come in cars with air conditioning from places like La Crescenta and Glendale. They talk about fancy vacations, big houses, and dream schools.\n\nErika cheers for Luisa in Spanish: \"You can do it, Luisa!\"\n\n\"You can aim for more,\" she often tells her daughter.\n\n\"I don’t know exactly what 'more' is,\" Erika says. \"But it’s something big, and we won’t stop until she gets there.\"\n\nEight years ago, Luisa’s dad became a long-distance truck driver. His earnings helped them get by. But last year, new rules forced him to stop driving his truck, and he had to declare bankruptcy. Now, he struggles to find steady work and is only home about four nights a month.\n\nAt home, Erika focuses on Luisa and her 8-year-old brother, Erick. They live in a small, old apartment in a neighborhood where rents are rising fast. Some landlords are trying to push people out.\n\nErika makes their home as nice as she can. She painted the walls bright colors and put a Virgen de Guadalupe statue in the hallway. She keeps two parakeets in a cage outside and added ceiling fans so the kids don’t have to open the windows when it’s hot. That way, they avoid the smell of marijuana smoke coming from the street.\n\nAt 34, Erika doesn’t spend time on herself. She wears old sweatpants, ties her frizzy hair in a bun, and has tired eyes. But she runs her home like a strict mom. Luisa’s many soccer trophies and medals are neatly displayed. School schedules and multiplication tables are taped to the walls. By Luisa’s desk, there are signs with words like \"joy\" and \"inspire.\"\n\nOn Friday nights, Erika teaches Spanish lessons in their living room. She wants her kids to speak both English and Spanish perfectly.\n\nWhenever there’s extra money, Erika uses it for her kids: jujitsu, English tutoring, and swimming lessons. She hopes to add art and music someday.\n\nHer main lesson to the kids is: Never give up.\n\nWhen Luisa was in kindergarten, she was bullied because her teeth were very crooked. Erika complained to the school principal, but nothing changed. So, she moved Luisa to a private school. There was no money for tuition, and Erika knew her husband wouldn’t agree. She didn’t tell him. Instead, she got a discount from the school and spent only on the basics to afford it.\n\n\"Sometimes I think I’m crazy,\" Erika says. \"But for my kids, there are no excuses.\"\n\nThe whole family works hard to make ends meet. Erick collects bottles and cans to recycle during soccer games. Luisa makes colorful duct-tape flowers to sell at school. Erika sells bracelets, purses, and hair bows she buys cheaply in Los Angeles.\n\nSometimes friends help Erika find work, like counting tortillas at a factory, as long as it doesn’t interfere with her kids’ schedules.\n\nOne afternoon, they waited for the bus under a freeway. Luisa put on her soccer cleats and adjusted her pink hairband. She’s a kind girl but doesn’t smile much.\n\nWhen she talks about getting braces, her face lights up. At school, they announced a few students would get free braces.\n\n\"I really hope it’s me,\" she said. \"But if it’s not, I hope they go to someone who really needs them.\"\n\nThe next week, she found out she wasn’t chosen. She felt sad. On the way home, Erika tried to comfort her. \"Maybe God has a reason. What if your teeth are your secret power?\"\n\nErika tells Luisa to stay focused on her goals.\n\nLuisa’s days are long. She wakes up at 6 a.m. and goes to bed at 10 p.m. She eats, does homework, and naps on the train. She has a perfect 4.0 GPA. For high school, she dreams of attending elite private schools like Flintridge Sacred Heart or Harvard-Westlake. But there’s no train to those places, and Erika doesn’t drive. Someone gave Erika an old van, but it’s broken and too expensive to fix.\n\nStill, Erika is confident they’ll figure it out. If they can travel to soccer games in faraway places like San Francisco and San Luis Obispo, they can get to high school too.\n\nFor now, Luisa hopes to earn a scholarship to high school through soccer.\n\n\"I just have to push myself,\" she says. \"A lot of kids in Boyle Heights never get to leave. I have, so I have to be an example.\"\n\nWhen she plays soccer, Luisa forgets her worries. \"Everything I feel, I leave it on the field,\" she says.\n\nHer coach, Cherif Zein, says her future depends on how hard she works. Zein has coached soccer for 39 years and helped many kids reach college teams and even national teams.\n\nLuisa is a strong defender, he says. Last year, when the team traveled to Costa Rica for a tournament, her travel costs were covered.\n\nDuring practice, Luisa is always ready. Her coach calls out, \"OK, Luisa!\" and kicks the ball to her. She moves quickly, controls the ball, and scores.\n\n\"Gooal!\" the coach shouts, raising his hands.\n\nErika watches from her folding chair, smiling proudly. \"On the field,\" the coach says, \"it doesn’t matter where you’re from or how much money you have. It’s just the kids and the ball.\"\n\nAnd that’s why Luisa loves soccer so much."

        "gpt": "CHICAGO — Kelsey Pearsall-Brandon, a 20-year-old from Lake in the Hills, Illinois, knows what she wants to do. She wants to be a police officer. But something is holding her back: math.\n\nIn a remedial algebra class at Elgin Community College, Kelsey faced a problem like this:\n\n-24 = 5*x* + 16  \n\nThe class cost her over $400, and she has to pass it to get her degree, which could help her career. But does she think she’ll need algebra as a cop? “Not really,” she said. “I need to catch the criminal. I’m not going to be solving for X.”\n\nKelsey’s frustration is common. More than half of college students in the U.S. take remedial classes, which cost over $3 billion every year. But these classes rarely help students graduate. Many experts are now saying it’s time to rethink how math is taught, especially in community colleges.\n\nMath is often the hardest subject for students, and some believe the focus on algebra doesn’t match what many students need for their jobs. Meanwhile, useful skills like statistics and practical math are often left out. This mismatch can trap students. They spend money on classes that don’t count toward their degrees, and many end up dropping out.\n\n“Remedial math is where dreams die,” said Anthony Bryk, a leader in education reform. “If you can’t pass it, you can’t move forward.”\n\nSome Illinois community colleges are trying a new way to teach math. This approach, called “math literacy,” focuses on real-life problems instead of abstract equations. It helps students learn math they’ll actually use in their jobs while skipping the parts they won’t need.\n\n“We’re not lowering the standards,” said Kathy Almy, a professor at Rock Valley College. “We’re just changing how we teach.”\n\nIn Illinois, high school students only need three years of math, and many skip it in their senior year. By the time they take college placement tests, they’ve forgotten much of what they learned. Students with low scores must start with basic math and work through several levels of algebra. These classes don’t count toward graduation, and the extra time and cost often cause students to quit.\n\nA group called Complete College America says only 14% of Illinois community college students who take remedial classes graduate in three years. To fix this, some colleges are offering refresher courses, tutoring, and online tools to help students catch up. But the math is usually the same as before.\n\n“I already learned this in high school,” said Rebeka Sendroiu, a student at Oakton Community College. “I don’t think I should have to take it again, but it’s required.”\n\nThe math literacy program aims to solve this problem. Instead of starting with math theory, teachers give students real-world questions, like figuring out how many wings they can buy at a restaurant after paying for a drink. As the problems get harder, students learn math skills step by step.\n\nAlmy says this practical approach works better for students who struggle with math. For example, when her class worked on a problem about buying wings, they started with simple math but soon had to deal with more complex equations involving tax and tip.\n\n“Would algebra make it easier?” Almy asked her students. “If so, use it.”\n\nVerenice Sandoval, an 18-year-old business major, said she likes this method. “This class feels more useful than algebra in high school,” she said. “We’re learning math we’ll actually use.”\n\nThe course allows students to finish their remedial math in one semester instead of two or three. About 65% of students pass, which is similar to traditional remedial math classes. However, there isn’t enough data yet to know if these students are more likely to graduate.\n\nSome professors are skeptical. They say many students struggle with basic math and reading, and this class won’t work for those in science or technology fields. Oakton math teacher Nancy Ressler says skipping traditional math could limit students’ future options. She believes learning to solve tough problems is a valuable skill.\n\nStill, math literacy is gaining support. Brian Durham from the Illinois Community College Board says, “Eventually, most colleges will do this.” Almy hopes the program will make math education more realistic.\n\n“Traditional math treats every student like they want to be a doctor,” she said. “But not everyone is going to be a doctor.”"

        "gpt": "LIVERMORE, Calif. — Imagine you wake up with a headache, stuffy nose, and feel too tired to get out of bed. You go to the doctor, and with a quick cheek swab placed in a small device, they find out exactly what’s making you sick. In minutes, they know if it’s a virus or bacteria and give you the right treatment.\n\nThis idea sounds like something from \"Star Trek,\" but it could soon be real. Lawrence Livermore Laboratory engineer Elizabeth Wheeler says it might be in clinics within 10 years.\n\nWheeler’s team, led by scientist Reginald Beer, is working on a way to quickly find what’s causing illnesses. They do this by taking the DNA of the virus or bacteria and making copies of it until there’s enough to identify.\n\n“It’s like making photocopies,” Wheeler explained. “Once you have enough, you can figure out what it is.”\n\nThe process, called polymerase chain reaction (PCR), isn’t new. It was invented in 1983 by scientist Kary Mullis, who won a Nobel Prize for it. PCR has been used for many things, like identifying human remains, checking food safety, and finding bacteria.\n\nHere’s how it works: DNA has two strands. In PCR, a special enzyme is added, and the DNA is heated to 94°C (202°F). This separates the strands, and the enzyme helps create matching strands. By heating and cooling the sample repeatedly in a machine about the size of two toasters stacked together, the DNA doubles every cycle. After about 30 cycles, there’s enough DNA to identify. This takes about three minutes.\n\nThe goal is to have PCR machines in every doctor’s office. Patients could provide a sample, and while the doctor does their checkup, the machine could process the DNA. In just a few minutes—about as long as it takes to pop microwave popcorn—the doctor could know if it’s a virus or bacteria and decide on treatment.\n\n“Everyone gets frustrated when the doctor can’t tell if it’s a virus or bacteria,” Wheeler said. “This could solve that problem. They could say, ‘It’s bacteria, here’s an antibiotic,’ or ‘It’s a virus, go home and rest.’”\n\nDr. Stephen Bustin, an expert on PCR, says the process used to take hours, but now it’s much faster. While the DNA copying takes three minutes, other steps make the whole process longer. In a year or two, results in under 10 minutes might become normal.\n\n“This could change how we diagnose illnesses,” Bustin said. Doctors could test samples while talking to patients.\n\nSince 2010, Beer’s team has worked to speed up PCR. They made the copying part faster by cooling the DNA quickly with cold water and then heating it again. This cycle repeats 30 times, and the results are compared to known DNA patterns. Wheeler believes they can make it even faster.\n\nThe next step is improving how the machine detects DNA and making the preparation steps quicker. Wheeler says they’re close to making the whole process take under 10 minutes.\n\nDr. John Leamon, a biotech expert, says fast PCR could also be useful outside clinics. It could help in the military to detect dangerous germs or test food for harmful bacteria before it’s shipped. During disease outbreaks, such as SARS, airports could test passengers in minutes instead of quarantining them for days.\n\nTwo companies are already interested in using this technology, according to lab spokesman Steve Wampler. However, a version for consumers might still take 5 to 7 years to develop."

        "gpt": "JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia — While the NBA season starts in America, some women and girls in Saudi Arabia are chasing their own basketball dreams.\n\nBasketball is becoming more popular with Saudi women, even though there are many rules limiting what women can do in public. With help from U.S.-trained coaches, women are using basketball to push for more rights both on and off the court.\n\n“We are an activist team,” said Lina Almaeena, who started Saudi Arabia’s first women’s basketball team 11 years ago. This led to the creation of Jiddah United in 2006, the first sports club in Saudi Arabia to include women. “We wanted to promote the sport at a time when women’s sports were considered unacceptable.”\n\nFor these women, basketball is more than a game. It’s a way to stand up in a country where many people think women shouldn’t exercise. Girls in public schools still don’t have physical education classes.\n\nWomen in Saudi Arabia follow strict dress rules. They can’t jog in public wearing sweatpants or shorts. Most wear a black robe called an abaya and cover their hair and face with a niqab. Yet, women’s basketball is growing. Some players even compete in other Arab countries. Hadeer Sadagah, 20, started playing with Almaeena at Jiddah United eight years ago. Now, she plays college basketball in the United Arab Emirates.\n\n“Basketball changed me,” Sadagah said. “It made me more confident, social, and active in school and life.”\n\nAt a recent practice in Jiddah, girls as young as 4 played basketball on outdoor courts behind high walls. Boys played on nearby courts. Everyone stopped for prayers during practice.\n\nAlmaeena says basketball is popular with girls because it’s a team sport and can be played in modest clothing. Girls can practice indoors or outdoors, away from public view.\n\nFrom its start at Jiddah United, women’s basketball has grown into a network of teams in several cities. There’s no official league, but women’s teams play in private tournaments with schools, universities, and clubs.\n\nStill, women’s basketball faces big challenges in Saudi Arabia. Strict rules separate men and women, so women’s teams aren’t part of the country’s main sports organizations. They struggle to find places to train and can’t attend matches in stadiums. In Jiddah, older players practice in women-only gyms and play tournaments in front of female audiences. Male coaches aren’t allowed at games.\n\nSaudi Arabia didn’t send any women to the Olympics until 2012, and only two competed. In 2014, the country sent only male athletes to the Asian Games.\n\nSome conservatives in Saudi Arabia are against women playing sports. Religious leaders have said sports like basketball could harm women’s bodies or make them act less feminine. In 2009, Almaeena’s team faced criticism when they played in Jordan. Photos of the players in track suits, not abayas, appeared in local newspapers, and critics called them “immoral.”\n\nJiddah is the most open and liberal city in Saudi Arabia. Its culture is different from cities like Riyadh, the capital. In Jiddah, women are more active in public. Some even walk or exercise outdoors, which is rare in other parts of the country. However, women’s sports in Jiddah are still mostly for wealthy families. Joining a club like Jiddah United costs about $130 a month, and women need to hire drivers to get to practices since they can’t drive themselves.\n\nFor now, women’s basketball in Saudi Arabia is still small, but it gives players and their families a chance to exercise and learn life skills.\n\n“Sports teach leadership, teamwork, and time management,” said American coach Umar Abdul Salam, who has trained kids in Jiddah for over 10 years. “If you want to get better, you have to work for it.”\n\nAlaa AlShuwayer, a mother of two young girls, recently watched a basketball practice in Jiddah. She plans to sign up her daughters.\n\n“There’s nothing wrong with girls playing sports,” she said. “I’d rather they play basketball than spend money on dresses and jewelry.”"

        "gpt": "LOS ANGELES - A fake science paper was created to expose bad practices in some science journals. Shockingly, 157 open-access journals agreed to publish it.\n\nJohn Bohannon, a writer for the journal *Science*, ran this sting operation. He found that some publishers act like the \"Wild West.\" They use fake addresses, fake names, overseas bank accounts, and do poor or fake \"peer reviews.\"\n\nBohannon explained that open-access journals started about 10 years ago with good intentions. But now, many of these journals focus on making money by charging authors fees instead of using subscriptions. He said many journals hide their editors' identities, locations, and financial details.\n\nTo test these journals, Bohannon wrote a fake and flawed study about a \"cure\" for cancer. He sent versions of this paper to 304 journals. The paper had obvious mistakes that should have been caught in a proper review.\n\nFor example, the paper claimed a molecule from lichen could stop cancer cells from growing. But the experiments had no control groups, which is a basic requirement. It also said the study used so much alcohol in the tests that it would have killed the cells.\n\nEven with these errors, 157 journals accepted the paper. Only 98 rejected it, and 49 never responded. The journals that accepted the bad paper asked for fees, sometimes costing thousands of dollars.\n\nOne accepting journal was the *American Journal of Polymer Science*, owned by Scientific & Academic Publishing (SAP). SAP lists its address in Rosemead, California, but this address is just an intersection. There are no phone numbers for the journal or its staff.\n\nBohannon contacted a scientist listed as a reviewer for SAP. She said she reviewed one paper and found it full of mistakes. \"I thought it was a joke,\" she said. She later asked to be removed as a reviewer.\n\nNot all journals failed the test. Bohannon noted that some journals, even those criticized in the past, did a good job. For example, *PLOS ONE*, a well-known open-access journal, flagged the fake paper for ethical concerns and rejected it."

        "gpt": "TOPPENISH, Wash. — The Yakama Nation is located in an area known for illegal marijuana growing.\n\nThe land is good for farming, and the growing season is long. Recently, the largest illegal marijuana crop in the state’s history was found on sacred Yakama land, where the tribe hunts and gathers food near Mount Adams.\n\nA year ago, Washington voters made recreational marijuana use legal. The state is now preparing to allow people to grow, sell, and process marijuana legally. But the Yakama Nation, which has fought substance abuse for many years, does not want marijuana on its land.\n\nGeorge Colby, a lawyer for the Yakama, spoke at a state meeting. He warned people not to invest in marijuana businesses in central Washington. “We will come after you,” Colby said. “We can call the federal government and have you removed from our land.”\n\nSince marijuana became legal, many places in Washington have tried to keep it out. But the Yakama Nation has stronger reasons than most. The tribe has a 158-year-old treaty that bans alcohol on its land. Their casino is one of the few in the U.S. that does not sell alcohol. Despite these rules, drug and alcohol problems have hurt many Yakama families.\n\nYakama Chairman Harry Smiskin said the tribe does not want marijuana grown, sold, or used on their land. He said the tribe has had bad experiences with both alcohol and marijuana in the past and continues to fight them.\n\nThe Yakama signed a treaty in 1855 under pressure. Today, this treaty is their main governing document. It protects their land and rights. The Yakama reservation covers about one million acres, but the tribe also has rights to more than 12 million additional acres for hunting, fishing, and gathering food.\n\nThe treaty, Yakama law, and federal law all ban marijuana on Yakama land. The state Liquor Control Board said it will not issue marijuana licenses on federal land, including reservations. However, there are cities like Toppenish, Wapato, and Harrah within the Yakama Nation’s boundaries. No licenses have been given to these cities yet, but applications have been filed for marijuana businesses near the reservation.\n\nThe Yakama Nation has created a system to track marijuana license applications. They are preparing to object to about 200 applications in 10 counties that include their land. Colby said, “The citizens of Washington don’t get to decide what happens on tribal land.”\n\nEvery summer, Yakama police and federal agents search the reservation for illegal marijuana. It’s a tough job, as growers, often linked to Mexican cartels, hide their crops well. Lieutenant Brian Frederickson, who helps with these efforts, said marijuana legalization will only make things harder. “Alcohol has already caused so much harm here,” he said. “Now we’ll have to deal with marijuana too.”\n\nEleanor Davis, a tribal elder, also opposed marijuana legalization. She worked for 20 years helping young people with drug and alcohol problems. Davis has lost loved ones to substance abuse, including her daughter and grandson. Her grandson died in a car accident after drinking. A cross now marks the spot where he passed away.\n\nDavis, who has been sober for 27 years, believes legal marijuana will harm the Yakama people. “It’s just going to create more damage,” she said. “And we don’t need that.”"

        "gpt": "LOS ANGELES — Snapchat started as a school project at Stanford University. The idea was simple: an app to send photos that disappear in seconds.\n\nAt first, classmates laughed at the idea of vanishing photos.\n\nFast forward four years, and Snapchat has grown into a big name. On Wednesday, it got a $200 million investment from Alibaba, a huge tech company from China. This deal raised Snapchat’s value to $15 billion, making it one of the top companies in Southern California.\n\nAlibaba’s investment shows how powerful Snapchat has become. With just 200 workers, it has become important in social media, advertising, and phone apps. It also shows how quickly small companies can grow big in today’s app-driven world.\n\nSnapchat began making money last year by selling ads to big companies like T-Mobile, Macy’s, and Electronic Arts. Even though it’s not making profits yet, these ads have made Snapchat a key player in social media.\n\nHowever, Snapchat's journey hasn’t been smooth. It faced problems like a lawsuit from a co-founder, leaked emails from its CEO, Evan Spiegel, and a data breach that raised privacy concerns. It also got criticism for rejecting Facebook’s $3 billion buyout offer in 2013. At the time, that price seemed crazy, but now Snapchat is worth much more.\n\nDespite challenges, Snapchat has stayed successful. It’s one of the most downloaded apps in many countries.\n\nAlibaba’s investment might help Snapchat in more ways than just money. Alibaba, a big name in China, wants to grow in the U.S. by focusing on online shopping and content. This partnership could open new ways for Snapchat to earn money.\n\nSnapchat was first launched in July 2011 under the name Picaboo. Later, founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy renamed it Snapchat. They started small, working from Spiegel’s dad’s house. At first, it became popular with college students because photos disappeared quickly, making it fun and private.\n\nIn class, Spiegel would check Snapchat’s growth. At first, one photo was sent every five minutes. By the end of the same class, it was one photo per second. Seeing this success, Spiegel left school to focus on Snapchat full-time. Soon, investors poured money into the company.\n\nBy late 2012, Snapchat users were sending 200 photos, or \"Snaps,\" every second. By summer 2013, that number grew to 4,000 Snaps per second. Over the years, Snapchat has raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors.\n\nSnapchat kept users interested by adding new features. One big change was \"Stories,\" where users could share posts that disappear after 24 hours. Users can also share public posts, which Snapchat organizes around events like the Grammys or places like UCLA.\n\nThese updates made Snapchat feel like Instagram, YouTube, and Twitter combined. Big media companies like CNN even create content just for Snapchat. They also make money by placing ads between their posts, and Snapchat shares this ad money with them.\n\nPopular Snapchat users, who make funny or cute videos, have also become stars. They get millions of views and earn money from advertisers by promoting products in their videos.\n\nStill, experts say Snapchat needs to attract older users to stay successful long-term, like Facebook and YouTube. Right now, most Snapchat users are teenagers and young adults. Some people think Snapchat could add new features to appeal to older audiences, while others believe it should stick to focusing on young users.\n\nSnapchat has also shown interest in new technology, like tools that recognize what’s in a photo. If combined with Alibaba’s online shopping, this could create a new way to advertise and sell products.\n\nFor now, Snapchat continues to grow and change, but the company declined to comment on its future plans."

        "gpt": "Climate change can cause unexpected problems, like more snakebites. A new study in Costa Rica found that snakebites happen more often during El Niño, both in its hot and cold phases. Poor, rural communities are affected the most.\n\nThe study, published in *Science Advances*, shows how climate change affects both animals and human health. It also highlights how these effects can hit some people harder than others, especially those already struggling economically.\n\nClimate change isn’t just about higher temperatures or rising seas. It also creates complex changes that can harm ecosystems and human health. For example, it can change how diseases spread. This study, however, looked at a different issue: snakebites.\n\n\"Snakebites don’t get enough attention, even though they’re a big problem,\" said Luis Fernando Chaves, the study’s lead author and an ecologist at Nagasaki University in Japan.\n\nEach year, 2.5 million people are bitten by snakes worldwide. About 400,000 suffer serious health problems, like nerve damage or amputations, and 85,000 die.\n\nSnakes are coldblooded, meaning they depend on their environment to control their body temperature. This makes their behavior sensitive to changes in the weather caused by climate change.\n\nThe researchers studied Costa Rica because it has universal health care and requires all snakebites to be reported. Most bites there come from one species, the terciopelo (*Bothrops asper*). Costa Rica also experiences major weather changes due to El Niño, a climate pattern that affects ocean temperatures in the Pacific.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2013, Costa Rica reported 6,424 snakebites. The study found that during the hot phase of El Niño, snakebites increased. This might be because snakes become more active in warmer weather and are more likely to cross paths with humans. \n\nSurprisingly, snakebites also rose during the cold phase of El Niño. This could happen because snakes may need to travel farther to find food when it’s colder.\n\nThe increase in snakebites mostly affects poor, rural people, Chaves said. This raises important questions: How can governments reduce the risk for people who are already struggling? What policies can help close the gap between rich and poor?\n\nThe authors believe more research is needed to understand the connection between poverty, climate change, and snakebites. \n\n\"Our findings show the need for more studies on snakebites, which are a neglected tropical disease,\" the authors wrote. They added that snakebites should be included on the list of health risks linked to environmental changes."

        "gpt": "WASHINGTON — The United States has sent 80 soldiers to Chad to help find over 270 girls who were kidnapped in Nigeria by a dangerous group called Boko Haram, the White House said on Wednesday.\n\nPresident Barack Obama wrote to Congress, saying the soldiers will stay in Chad until their help is no longer needed. They will assist with planes and drones that are searching for the girls in northern Nigeria and nearby areas.\n\nBy law, the president must tell Congress whenever U.S. troops are sent to another country.\n\nThe Pentagon said these soldiers will operate the unarmed drones and provide security. This decision increases the U.S. military's role in the search. Two weeks ago, the U.S. sent about 24 people, including intelligence and law enforcement officers, to help. Fewer than 10 of them were soldiers.\n\nOfficials think Boko Haram has split the girls into smaller groups and hidden them in thick forests in northeastern Nigeria, an area as big as the U.S. state of West Virginia. On Tuesday, a Pentagon spokesperson, Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby, said finding the girls is like \"looking for a needle in the jungle.\"\n\n\"We haven't seen anything that shows where they are,\" Kirby said. \"We are sharing what we find with the Nigerian government, but we haven't found any clear information.\"\n\nFor the past five years, Boko Haram has caused more violence in northern Nigeria, including kidnappings and attacks. On Wednesday, the group used car bombs to attack three villages near where the girls were taken, killing at least 40 people. A day earlier, they killed at least 118 people in a double bombing in the city of Jos.\n\nThe U.S. is being careful about working with Nigeria's military, which has been accused of mistreating people and may have members working with Boko Haram. A Pentagon official, Alice Friend, said the U.S. only helps groups that follow human rights rules.\n\nSince 2010, Boko Haram, whose name means \"Western education is forbidden,\" has killed at least 300 students. The group said they kidnapped the girls because they believe girls should marry instead of going to school.\n\nThe kidnapping caused outrage around the world and led to a popular Twitter campaign, #bringbackourgirls, supported by people like Michelle Obama. However, the campaign has lost some attention recently.\n\nAlthough U.S. troops are not in Nigeria, their involvement may upset some Nigerians. They worry the U.S. might use this as an excuse to expand its military presence in Africa.\n\nU.S. officials say Nigeria's military will have to rescue the girls if U.S. technology finds them. \"We’re not talking about U.S. troops going into Nigeria to find the girls,\" Kirby said earlier this month.\n\nThe last time U.S. troops were sent to Africa was in 2011. Back then, a small group was sent to help find Joseph Kony, the leader of a violent group called the Lord's Resistance Army. Kony is still in hiding, and U.S. troops are still searching for him."

To handle this, they have created \"rocket dockets\" to decide quickly if these children will be sent back to their home countries.\n\nVolunteer lawyers are working hard to prepare for up to 50 cases a day per judge. They aim to help the children get the right to stay in the U.S. or at least avoid being sent back right away.\n\nThis fast process is happening because many children from Central America are fleeing violence and poverty. Over 3,000 children have come to Florida this year to join family, but they still need to prove they can stay legally.\n\nThree immigration judges in Miami and two in Orlando are now focusing only on these children’s cases. Government officials promise the children will get a fair hearing, but advocates worry that rushing the process might not be fair.\n\nLesley Mendoza, who works with a group helping these children for free, said most of the children in court don’t have lawyers. \"They are expected to handle the legal system alone,\" she said. \"That’s not right. If they don’t have time to find a lawyer, many will be sent back. For some, going back means facing violence, gangs, or worse.\"\n\nIn Orlando, the same situation is happening. Camila Pachon Silva, an immigration lawyer, said many children are appearing in court alone. Her group is training more lawyers to help.\n\nThe number of children crossing the border has grown a lot recently. As of July 7, over 3,000 children from Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala have come to Florida this year. Florida has the third-highest number after Texas and New York. Most children stay with family members, and more are expected to arrive soon.\n\nA 2008 law says that children who cross the border alone must be given a chance to explain why they should stay if their home country is unsafe. Some children are allowed to stay, but others are sent back. The exact numbers are unclear.\n\nThe rise in children coming is linked to increased violence in countries like Honduras, where drug trafficking and gang violence have made life dangerous. Many of these children come to Florida, which has a large immigrant population, including the biggest Honduran community in the U.S.\n\nThe Orlando court handles cases from northern Florida, while the Miami court takes cases from southern Florida, including Broward and Palm Beach counties.\n\nJeffrey Brauwerman, a former immigration judge, said the special dockets can help clear up the backlog of cases. \"The goal is to move these cases quickly without taking away anyone’s rights,\" he said.\n\nFlorida has dealt with large waves of immigrants before, such as the Mariel Boatlift in 1980 and Haitian arrivals in the '80s and '90s. But using \"rocket dockets\" to speed up immigration cases is rare.\n\n\"When children cross the border, many travel to Miami because they have family here,\" Brauwerman said. \"Florida is still a gateway to the Americas.\""

Chen Guifang’s parents couldn’t find shelter in time.\n\nOn May 4, 1939, 7-year-old Chen was in a crowded cave in Chongqing, China’s wartime capital. Bombs fell outside, and shrapnel hit her, killing her parents. Now 83, Chen remembers being alone at 7, surrounded by the ruins of her city. The scars from the bombing are still on her face and arm.\n\n\"People buried my parents in a garden by the road,\" she said. \"I cried every day, asking why the bombs didn’t take me too.\"\n\nJapan invaded China in 1937, years before Pearl Harbor and the bombing of London. Chongqing was hit the hardest. From 1938 to 1941, Japanese planes bombed the city more than 200 times, killing almost 12,000 people, most of them civilians. On May 3 and 4, 1939, thousands died in just two days of attacks.\n\nFor a long time, histories of World War II didn’t talk much about what Chongqing went through. But recently, people have started to recognize its suffering. As China marked the 70th anniversary of the end of the war, Chongqing, often called \"the city of heroes,\" gained more attention.\n\nOxford historian Rana Mitter wrote a book called *Forgotten Ally* about China’s role in resisting Japan. He said Chongqing faced bombings without strong air defenses, unlike London, which was protected by the Royal Air Force. \"For Chongqing’s people, it was terrifying,\" he said. Few cities had ever been bombed so much for so long.\n\nToday, Chongqing is a bustling city with skyscrapers. It’s hard to imagine the destruction it faced during the war. Before 1939, the city was already busy because refugees fled there after Japan invaded places like Shanghai and Nanjing. China’s government, led by Chiang Kai-shek, also moved to Chongqing to escape the Japanese army.\n\nWang Xifu, now 80, remembers fleeing to Chongqing with his family in 1937. They walked for 20 days to reach Wuhan and then took a boat to Chongqing. Once there, they opened a successful restaurant. But on May 3, 1939, Japanese planes bombed the city. Wang’s family ran to a sawmill to hide. The bombs destroyed the sawmill, killing his parents. Wang survived but didn’t realize his parents had died until the next day.\n\nAnother survivor, Lu Xianbo, lost his father during the second day of bombing on May 4, 1939. His father left a cave to check on their city house during a break in the airstrikes but was killed when the bombings resumed. Lu was told the story by his uncle.\n\nThe bombings caused chaos. In 1941, a stampede during an air-raid warning killed many people. On another day, over 2,000 people suffocated in a tunnel during a long bombing raid. Japan’s goal was to force China to surrender, but like the bombings in London, it only made people more determined to fight back.\n\nLife was hard for survivors. Chen, an orphan, lived in a tent and sold leftover coal to make money. She later worked in a factory, got married, and started a family. Wang, also orphaned, became homeless at 9. He earned money by searching sewers for lost items and fanning people in restaurants in exchange for food.\n\nDuring the war, Chongqing’s suffering was shown in newsreels, which helped the U.S. see Japan’s aggression before Pearl Harbor. But after the war, Chongqing was largely forgotten. When Mao Zedong’s Communist Party won China’s civil war, he downplayed Chongqing’s role because it was tied to Chiang Kai-shek, his rival.\n\nIn recent years, China has begun to recognize Chongqing’s history. The city’s Three Gorges Museum has displays about the Japanese bombings. Chiang Kai-shek’s old retreat has also been restored, showing him as a leader in China’s resistance.\n\nChongqing also highlights its wartime friendship with the U.S. One museum honors the \"Flying Tigers,\" American pilots who helped defend China. Another museum is dedicated to General Joseph Stillwell, an American commander who worked with Chiang Kai-shek.\n\nWhile many in Chongqing have warm feelings for the U.S., feelings about Japan are more complicated. Some residents say they don’t blame Japanese people today but believe Japan hasn’t fully admitted to its wartime crimes. Over 180 bombing survivors have tried to sue Japan for compensation and an apology. Although a Japanese court rejected their case, they continue to fight.\n\nHistorian Rana Mitter says these lawsuits are about recognition, not money. Survivors like Lu agree. \"We will keep pushing until they admit the truth,\" Lu said. \"If we fail, the next generation will continue this fight.\""

However, about 6,000 people, including Bangladeshis and Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar, are still stuck on overcrowded wooden boats. They are running out of food and clean water, and their situation is becoming very dangerous.\n\nOn Monday, one boat entered Indonesian waters. The navy stopped it and gave the passengers food, water, and directions to Malaysia. According to navy spokesman First Adm. Manahan Simorangkir, the boat was in good shape, and the people on board seemed fine, though they were cramped.\n\nThere is growing fear that boats might soon reach shore with dead passengers. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, the U.S., and other governments and organizations have held emergency meetings. However, they have no immediate plans to search for the boats in the busy Malacca Strait.\n\nOne big issue is what to do with the Rohingya if they are rescued. Myanmar does not recognize them as citizens, calling them illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Other countries worry that helping a few might lead to a large wave of poor migrants looking for help.\n\n“These people are in a terrible situation,” said Phil Robertson of Human Rights Watch. He urged governments to work together to rescue those still at sea, some of whom have been stranded for over two months. “Time is running out,” he added.\n\nThe Rohingya are a Muslim minority in Myanmar, a mostly Buddhist country. They have faced discrimination from the government for decades. Myanmar considers them outsiders, even though many Rohingya families have lived there for generations.\n\nIn the past three years, violence against the Rohingya has killed up to 280 people and forced 140,000 to leave their homes. Many now live in overcrowded camps near the Rakhine state capital, Sittwe. These camps have poor conditions, with little access to schools or health care.\n\nThe harsh conditions and lack of jobs have caused many Rohingya to flee by boat. This is one of the largest movements of migrants by sea since the Vietnam War.\n\nChris Lewa, who leads the nonprofit Arakan Project, says more than 100,000 people have left by boat since mid-2012. Most aim to reach Malaysia. However, recent crackdowns on human smugglers have left many migrants stuck at sea. In some cases, families have paid over $2,000 for their release, but the migrants remain trapped.\n\nLewa estimates that around 7,000 Rohingya and Bangladeshis are still on boats in the Malacca Strait and nearby waters."

        "gpt": "LOS ANGELES — Joanna Robles found a $14.99 Batman costume with a bib and booties while shopping for her baby boy. She plans to dress him up while giving out candy on Halloween. \"His dad loves superheroes,\" she said at a Spirit Halloween store near Los Angeles.\n\nNearby, 35-year-old Joe Lige was looking for a spooky costume for a Halloween party. \"My wife sets a budget for me, but I always spend more,\" he joked.\n\nThey are just two of the 157 million Americans celebrating Halloween this year. People celebrate by taking kids trick-or-treating, carving pumpkins, or dressing up for parties.\n\nHalloween used to be mostly for kids, but now many adults enjoy it too. It has become a big holiday for fun and escape. \"It's not just for kids anymore,\" said Trisha Lombardo, a spokesperson for Spirit Halloween, which runs 1,150 pop-up stores for the season.\n\nThis year, Americans are expected to spend $6.9 billion on Halloween, averaging $74.34 per person, according to the National Retail Federation. While that's less than the $8 billion spent in 2012, it's still much more than a decade ago.\n\nThe money spent on Halloween helps many businesses, especially in California. Amusement parks like Knott's Berry Farm turn into haunted attractions, and California grows more pumpkins for Halloween than any other state.\n\nThere’s no single reason why Halloween has become so popular, but businesses say social media plays a big role. People love sharing costume ideas and photos online. Websites like Facebook and Pinterest inspire many costume choices. \"I post my outfit on Instagram and Facebook,\" said Jessica Medina, 33, while shopping at Spirit Halloween.\n\nRetail experts say Halloween has become more social. People enjoy celebrating with friends and sharing their experiences online. Spending on Halloween, however, is still much smaller than during the winter holidays like Christmas, which brings in $616 billion.\n\nHalloween spending is expected to drop slightly this year because many people are reusing decorations. Spending on decorations is predicted to total $1.9 billion, down 7% from last year. \"People are using what they already have,\" said Kathy Grannis Allen from the National Retail Federation.\n\nStill, other Halloween items, like candy and pumpkins, need to be bought fresh. Americans are expected to spend $2.1 billion on candy this year. About 41% of Americans will carve pumpkins, and California leads the country in pumpkin production.\n\nTemporary Halloween stores, like Spirit Halloween, have also grown in popularity. These \"pop-up\" shops open for about six weeks before Halloween. Spirit Halloween is the largest, while Party City runs both regular stores and 300 temporary Halloween City shops. Halloween makes up 25% of Party City's $1.6 billion in annual sales.\n\nTheme parks also cash in on Halloween. Knott's Berry Farm, for example, turns into \"Scary Farm\" for 24 nights, with separate $39.99 tickets. Halloween events like this bring in extra money and visitors. \"It's a profitable part of our year,\" said Knott's spokesman Jason Soyster.\n\nOthers celebrate Halloween closer to home, handing out candy or hosting small parties. Jessica Medina, who loves Halloween, said she tries to keep her family's spending under $200. \"I try, but it never works,\" she said while looking at a $60 pirate costume. \"My husband and I are big Halloween fans.\""

        "gpt": "EAST HARTFORD, Conn. — For many years, companies like Pratt & Whitney have made engine parts using tools, machines, and traditional methods like cutting and shaping metal.\n\nNow, they’re using 3-D printers.\n\nThese printers don’t use paper or ink like the ones in your office. Instead, they use lasers to heat tiny pieces of plastic or metal, building parts layer by layer. These printers can make very detailed and complex designs.\n\nAerospace companies like Pratt & Whitney and GE Aviation are pushing this technology further. They’re using it to create parts for their newest engines. This method allows them to design parts that were impossible to make with old methods. It also saves money and can make parts lighter.\n\n3-D printing, also called additive manufacturing, has proven it can handle tough jobs, like making parts for jet engines. Tom Maloney, a technology expert, called it a big step forward. \"We’ve learned a lot about how to use these machines,\" he said. He believes this technology will become more common in manufacturing.\n\nPratt & Whitney, part of United Technologies, has already placed over 25 3-D-printed parts in its new PurePower geared turbofan engine. These parts include simple items like brackets and more complex pieces that face high heat and stress. GE Aviation is also using 3-D printing to make fuel nozzles for its engines. These nozzles are now made as one piece instead of 18 separate parts, making them lighter and easier to produce.\n\nThe main benefit of 3-D printing is that it allows designers to create parts that were once impossible to manufacture. With traditional methods, engineers sometimes had to settle for less-than-perfect designs because of production limits. Now, they can make complex parts just as easily as simple ones.\n\nThe technology also has big potential for the military. With a 3-D printer and the right materials, the military could print spare parts, tools, or even buildings in remote areas. For example, an aircraft carrier could act as a \"floating factory,\" making parts for tanks or planes on demand.\n\nPratt & Whitney started experimenting with 3-D printers in 1988. Back then, they used the machines to make plastic prototypes for testing. Today, they can print directly in metal, skipping some old manufacturing steps. This saves time and money.\n\nGE Aviation has also invested in 3-D printing. It bought a 3-D printing company and plans to spend $3.5 billion on this technology over the next five years.\n\nAdditive manufacturing works like building something with Lego blocks, adding pieces together. Traditional manufacturing, called subtractive manufacturing, is more like sculpting, where you remove material to create the final shape. While most factories still use subtractive methods, additive manufacturing is growing quickly. In 2012, the 3-D printing industry was worth $2.2 billion. By 2021, experts think it could grow to $10.1 billion.\n\nPrinting parts for jet engines is a major test for 3-D printing. These parts must handle extreme heat, stress, and long-term use. Experts say this is a big step for the manufacturing industry. It’s one thing to print a plastic toy, but it’s much harder to make a metal part that works in a jet engine.\n\nAdvances in computer power and material science have helped 3-D printing succeed. Supercomputers now allow engineers to handle the complex calculations needed for this technology. Dave Hudson, a leader in additive manufacturing, said, \"This wouldn’t be possible without today’s powerful computers.\"\n\nThe military is excited about this technology too. Lt. Cmdr. Michael Llenza of the U.S. Navy wrote that 3-D printers could someday make vehicle parts, drones, shelters, and even food. He explained that a 3-D printer on an aircraft carrier could supply troops with parts they need, even in remote locations. He compared this to the Apollo 13 mission, saying, \"What if the crew could have just printed the part they needed?\"\n\nThere are still challenges, like printing with multiple materials or making parts that can handle the toughest conditions. But companies like Pratt & Whitney and GE are working to solve these problems. For now, 3-D printing is opening new possibilities in manufacturing, and its future looks bright."

        "gpt": "MIAMI — There's a strange and slimy creature making its way into the U.S. It’s called the New Guinea flatworm. This worm has a mouth on its belly that spits out goo, is covered in toxic slime, and carries a brain-eating parasite. Now, it’s made its way to Miami.\n\nThe flatworm is hermaphroditic, meaning it doesn’t need a mate to reproduce. It can multiply on its own, anytime and anywhere.\n\nScientists recently confirmed the worm has been found in four places in Miami-Dade County, including Coral Gables. The worm is small, only about 2 inches long, and looks like a shiny smear. But it’s a dangerous predator. It feeds on snails and poses a threat to South Florida’s fragile snail population.\n\n\"It's disgusting,\" said David Robinson, a snail expert with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. \"I’ve seen a lot as a biologist, but this is really gross.\"\n\nExperts are concerned the flatworm could spread to other parts of Florida and the U.S. It can travel in garden soil or on plants moved from place to place.\n\nThe worm is native to New Guinea and has been found in 22 countries, mostly on islands. In the U.S., it was first reported in Miami in 2012. Since then, it has been spotted a few more times in the area, including in a botanical garden where a scientist found one late at night.\n\nThese worms have a unique way of eating. They latch onto a snail’s shell, spit out their stomachs, and release an acidic goo to dissolve the snail’s flesh. Then, they pull their stomachs back in, swallowing the snail as they go.\n\nThe worm is especially dangerous because it carries a parasite called the rat lungworm. This parasite can infect humans, causing muscle pain and sensitivity to light. In rare cases, it can infect the brain. The worm’s toxic slime can also cause allergic reactions, so people should avoid touching it.\n\nThe flatworm has already caused problems in places like Guam and the Mariana Islands by wiping out native snails. Scientists worry South Florida’s native snails, which are already struggling due to habitat loss, climate change, and invasive species, could be next.\n\n\"If these snails disappear from South Florida, they’re gone forever,\" said Makiri Sei, another snail scientist."

        "gpt": "NEW YORK — Harper Lee, the famous author of *To Kill a Mockingbird*, will have a second book published.\n\nThe new book, called *Go Set a Watchman*, was written in the 1950s but set aside and only recently rediscovered. It will come out on July 14. Although it was written first, the story takes place after the events of *To Kill a Mockingbird*. The 304-page book will be Lee’s first new work in more than 50 years.\n\nThe publisher plans to print 2 million copies for the first release.\n\n\"In the 1950s, I wrote a book called *Go Set a Watchman*,\" Lee, now 88 years old, said. \"It follows Scout as an adult. My editor liked the parts about Scout’s childhood and asked me to write a new story from her younger point of view. That became *To Kill a Mockingbird*. I thought the original book was lost, so I was surprised and happy when my friend and lawyer, Tonja Carter, found it. After thinking about it, I shared it with a few trusted people, and they said it was worth publishing. I’m amazed that it will finally be shared after all these years.\"\n\nThe deal to publish the book was made between Tonja Carter and Michael Morrison, the head of HarperCollins Publishers. It will also be published in the UK by William Heinemann, part of Penguin Random House.\n\nThe publisher said Carter found the manuscript attached to an early version of *To Kill a Mockingbird*. The story is set in Maycomb, Alabama, during the 1950s, about 20 years after *To Kill a Mockingbird*. At that time, the civil rights movement was growing. In 1953, the Supreme Court ruled that segregated schools were illegal, and Rosa Parks’ arrest in 1955 started the Montgomery bus boycott.\n\nIn the new book, Scout (Jean Louise Finch) returns to Maycomb from New York to visit her father, Atticus. She struggles with her father’s views on society and her own feelings about her hometown.\n\nHarper Lee grew up in Monroeville, Alabama, and lived in New York in the 1950s. She now lives in her hometown. The publisher says the book will be released exactly as Lee wrote it, with no changes.\n\n*To Kill a Mockingbird* is one of the most loved books of all time, selling over 40 million copies worldwide. It was first published on July 11, 1960, won the Pulitzer Prize, and was made into a famous movie in 1962 starring Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch. The book is often studied in schools, but some have banned it because of its language and themes about race. The fact that Lee never wrote another book made *To Kill a Mockingbird* even more special.\n\nThe publisher said Lee probably won’t do any interviews or events for the new book. She has rarely spoken to the media since the 1960s, when she said she wanted to create a record of life in small Southern towns. Until now, *To Kill a Mockingbird* was her only published book.\n\n\"This is an amazing literary event,\" said Jonathan Burnham, a publisher at Harper. \"No one knew about *Go Set a Watchman* until recently, and finding it is a wonderful surprise for fans of *To Kill a Mockingbird*. The book reads like a sequel and is a touching story about a father and daughter and a small Alabama town dealing with racial issues in the 1950s.\"\n\nThe new book will also be available as an e-book. While Lee has said she prefers paper books, she surprised fans last year by allowing *To Kill a Mockingbird* to be released as an e-book."

        "gpt": "CHICAGO — Ads for fresh juices claim they give quick energy, help with weight loss, and are full of vitamins and minerals, all in one easy drink.  \n\nMany health-conscious people believe this and buy lots of juice. Jamba Juice, a company selling juices and smoothies, made $55.1 million in one quarter of the year. Big companies like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo also jumped on the juice trend by buying brands like Odwalla and Naked Juice.\n\nAt The Protein Bar, a health food chain in Chicago, 10% of sales come from fruit and vegetable juices. Customers think juice is an important part of a healthy diet, said founder Matt Matros.  \n\nJuicers for home use are also popular. Some models cost as much as $1,200. On Amazon, more than 40 books about juice and smoothies were released in just one month, most focusing on health or weight loss.\n\nBut experts say juice isn't as healthy as it seems. Barry Popkin, a nutrition professor, says the juice industry markets juice as healthy, but it removes the fiber found in whole fruits. This fiber is important for health, and without it, juice is just sugar and calories.  \n\nPopkin warns that drinking juice regularly can increase the risk of diabetes and weight gain. A 2010 study in Singapore showed people who drank two or more servings of juice per week were 29% more likely to develop diabetes. This was not far behind soda drinkers, who had a 42% higher risk.\n\nFreshly pressed juices from juice bars are no better than store-bought ones, Popkin added. Smoothies are a bit better because they include the whole fruit, but they still have lots of calories. Choosing vegetable-based juices or smoothies can help lower the sugar content.\n\nElizabeth Ward, a dietitian, says juice isn’t a miracle drink, but it can be a better choice than sugary drinks. Karen May, from Naked Juice, says juice helps people get more vitamins and minerals, which many Americans lack.\n\nHowever, Lara Field, a dietitian, says the sugar in juice outweighs the benefits of its vitamins. She explains that eating too much fruit can lead to weight gain, just like eating candy. Whole fruits, with their fiber, are much healthier. Fiber helps people feel full and prevents overeating, says Bethany Doerfler, a dietitian at Northwestern Medicine.  \n\nMost Americans don’t eat enough fiber, says Joanne Slavin, a professor at the University of Minnesota. Fiber helps lower the risk of heart disease and keeps weight in check, but most adults eat only half the recommended daily amount. Slavin wants people to eat more fiber, especially from whole fruits.\n\nA 2009 study showed that eating apple slices before lunch made people feel fuller and eat fewer calories compared to drinking apple juice. Even applesauce, which contains fiber, didn’t fill people up as much as whole apples.\n\nField points out that chewing food helps the body realize it’s full. A study found that people who chewed longer ate fewer calories later, even when the same amount of food was delivered to their stomachs through a feeding tube.\n\nSome experts admit drinking juice is better than not eating fruits or vegetables at all. Diane Welland, a dietitian, says 4 ounces of 100% fruit juice counts as a half-cup of fruit, according to federal guidelines. But these guidelines also recommend eating mostly whole fruits.\n\nEating the recommended amount of fruits and vegetables—up to 2 cups of fruit and 3 cups of vegetables daily—can be hard. That’s why many people turn to juices and smoothies.  \n\nSmoothies and juices, especially those with mostly vegetables and a little fruit for taste, can help people eat more plants, says Doerfler. Nutritionist Christina Stark agrees that any step toward eating more fruits and vegetables is good, but variety is key. People should try different fruits and vegetables in different forms, not just juice."

        "gpt": "WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama is entering the last two years of his presidency, but his power is weaker now. This happens to most presidents in their second term. However, Obama faces a very divided political situation, making it hard to work with Congress. With Republicans now in charge of the Senate, it will be even harder for him to tackle big problems at home and abroad.\n\nThere are many challenges. \n\nThe U.S. economy is growing, but wages are not rising, and the global economy is struggling. The Islamic State group is causing trouble in Iraq and Syria, testing U.S. policies despite ongoing airstrikes. In the U.S., the appearance of the deadly Ebola virus has scared people and raised concerns about how well the government can handle multiple crises. Also, a temporary budget deal with Congress is ending soon.\n\nNext week, Obama will travel to Asia and Australia for meetings, while Congress works on finishing the budget and other tasks. A new Republican-led Senate will take over soon.\n\nObama plans to act on his own for one issue. By the end of December, he will sign an order to allow some of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. to stay and work temporarily. He delayed this earlier to avoid hurting Democrats in the elections.\n\nBut working with Republicans in Congress will be tough. Republican Mitch McConnell, likely the next Senate leader, said he and Obama should work together on areas they agree on. However, he also said he doesn’t expect either of them to change their views.\n\nRepublican leader Reince Priebus said voters rejected Obama’s \"failed policies\" and that the president should listen to what people want.\n\nObama is expected to speak about the election results soon. On Friday, he will meet with Congress leaders, but the meeting may not go well. Experts think it’s unlikely that Congress and Obama will pass major new laws.\n\nAs Obama’s presidency winds down, many are already focusing on who will run for president in 2016. Lou D’Allesandro, a Democratic politician, said it’s hard for Obama to start any big projects now because Republicans will try to block him.\n\nObama’s approval ratings are low, which hurt Democrats in the recent elections. But Congress is also unpopular. Vice President Joe Biden believes Republicans may need to compromise with Obama to show voters they can get things done before the next election.\n\nOther presidents in their final years have faced similar challenges. Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush all had to deal with an opposition-led Congress in their last two years. Despite this, they still managed to achieve some goals.\n\nObama’s team says he still wants to leave a strong legacy. Republicans also want to show they can govern well. Experts believe that both sides have reasons to try to work together on issues like trade, taxes, immigration, and infrastructure.\n\nReagan, for example, passed major laws and made deals with Congress even during tough times. Ken Duberstein, Reagan’s former chief of staff, said Obama needs to build trust and work with Congress if he wants to accomplish anything in his final years.\n\nSome changes in Obama’s team may happen soon, but no big shakeups are expected right now, according to his press secretary.\n\nThere is still hope for progress. Obama and Congress could find common ground on several issues. Even judicial appointments, which often stall at the end of a presidency, could still move forward. A group that tracks judicial nominations pointed out that Reagan, Clinton, and Bush managed to get many judges approved during their last two years.\n\nIn the end, Obama will have to decide how much he wants to work with Congress to finish his presidency on a strong note."

        "gpt": "DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK, Calif. — The loud cracking sounds were surprising. A thin, frozen lake in Death Valley National Park was breaking apart under the bright sun.\n\nCousins Richard Norris and James Norris stood watching. A light wind pushed large chunks of ice across the water. These chunks hit rocks, some as heavy as 200 pounds, and started sliding them across the muddy bottom of the dry lake bed called \"the Racetrack Playa.\"\n\n\"My God, Jim, it's happening,\" Richard shouted.\n\nJames grabbed a camera.\n\nOn December 21, they took pictures that helped solve a long-standing mystery. For years, people wondered how rocks moved across the flat dirt in one of the hottest, driest places on Earth.\n\nThese rocks, some weighing up to 600 pounds, leave strange trails behind them. The trails twist like snakes or make loops, but there are no other marks to show what caused the movement.\n\nOver the years, people came up with many ideas. Some thought strong winds during rainstorms moved the rocks. Others believed ice helped push them. Some even blamed UFOs. But no one had clear proof—until the cousins got lucky that day. Their findings were shared in a science journal called *PLOS ONE*.\n\n\"In a place with only 2 inches of rain each year, it's amazing that rocks are moved by ice, like in the Arctic,\" James said. He added, \"And they move really slowly—about 15 feet per minute.\"\n\nScientists have studied these moving rocks since 1948. The mystery stayed unsolved for so long because the rocks only move under very rare conditions. Sometimes, nothing happens for decades.\n\nFirst, it has to rain in the dry desert. Then, the water must freeze before it dries up. Next, the sun has to melt the ice, and the wind must be strong enough to break the ice into pieces and move it over the shallow water. Even a gentle wind can work.\n\nRalph Lorenz, a scientist who studied the rocks for 10 years, thought ice was the answer. He set up cameras to catch the movement, but they didn’t work.\n\nThe Norris cousins had a different idea. They thought strong winds caused the movement. They started their \"Slithering Stones Research Initiative\" in 2011.\n\nOver two years, they got help from friends and family to set up a weather station and place 15 rocks with GPS trackers on the playa. These special rocks recorded how and when they moved.\n\nOn December 20, the cousins returned to check their equipment. They saw the lake was frozen and noticed fresh trails near pieces of broken ice.\n\nThe next day, while sitting on a nearby hill, they saw the ice start to break. A light wind moved the ice, and the rocks began sliding across the muddy ground.\n\n\"It was amazing to watch,\" Richard said. James added, \"It was bittersweet because the mystery was solved.\"\n\nWeather data showed that a rare winter storm in November had brought rain and snow. This created the shallow lake, and the rocks moved on sunny days with light winds after freezing nights.\n\nJames' photos showed thin ice sheets, hundreds of feet wide, pushing rocks along the slippery mud. The wind decided the direction and speed of the movement.\n\nThe cousins shared their discovery with Ralph Lorenz, who helped write the study for *PLOS ONE*. \"The mystery is solved, but it’s still an incredible and rare event,\" Lorenz said.\n\nRichard Friese, Death Valley's hydrologist, was glad the puzzle was solved. But he worried more people might visit the remote playa. The rough road leading there often causes flat tires and strands drivers.\n\nThe Norris cousins’ love for the area began in the 1960s. Their fathers, who were scientists, took them to explore the wild, rocky desert.\n\nStanding by a fresh trail on the playa under a starry sky, James said, \"Our fathers would have loved to know the answer to this mystery.\""

        "gpt": "ORLANDO, Fla. — Just over a minute after taking off from Kennedy Space Center, the space shuttle Challenger broke apart. A damaged rubber seal let rocket flames burst out, causing the shuttle's big fuel tank to explode.\n\nThe explosion left a lasting memory for many Americans. It happened 30 years ago, and one of the seven astronauts who died was teacher Christa McAuliffe.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan spoke to the nation after the tragedy. He said, \"We will never forget them,\" and promised that the crew’s dream of exploring space would continue.\n\nAt the time, the Challenger disaster brought people together. Many wanted to improve and keep moving forward. But over the years, fewer people remember the event, especially younger generations who weren’t alive then. The space shuttle program ended in 2011, and the way Americans think about space travel has changed.\n\nHoward Lieb, a dentist from New York, remembers the disaster clearly. He still thinks about the sadness on McAuliffe’s parents' faces. Back then, he said, people believed in trying again. But now, many see such risks as unacceptable.\n\nNASA’s future in space exploration is uncertain. The agency doesn’t have the money or the spacecraft to send astronauts to Mars anytime soon. Meanwhile, private companies like SpaceX, led by Elon Musk, and Blue Origin, led by Jeff Bezos, have brought excitement back to space travel. Last year, Cape Canaveral launched 17 rockets, the most in 12 years.\n\nThe Challenger Center for Space Science Education was set up in 1986 by the families of the astronauts who died. It now reaches millions of students in schools, museums, and universities. When kids visit these centers, they learn about the Challenger crew and their bravery.\n\nLaura Husband, whose father died in the Columbia shuttle disaster in 2003, said programs like these inspire people to dream and discover. Roger Launius, a space historian, said the Challenger explosion shattered the idea that NASA was invincible. It showed the dangers of overconfidence.\n\nAfter Challenger exploded, NASA promised to improve safety and fix problems with the shuttle. But when Columbia disintegrated during re-entry 17 years later, investigators found NASA still had serious safety issues.\n\nBob Crippen, a retired astronaut, said NASA's lessons from Challenger and Columbia remain important today. He warned that NASA now has less control over safety because private companies handle more space launches. SpaceX and other companies have also faced accidents with their rockets in recent years.\n\nSome experts believe private companies might avoid the same mistakes as NASA because they are smaller and face less political pressure. But others aren’t so sure. These companies still face challenges, like trying to keep NASA contracts.\n\nAt Kennedy Space Center, a new program called \"Apollo, Challenger, Columbia Lessons Learned\" aims to teach private companies about past space disasters. The goal is to help them avoid similar mistakes.\n\nMike Ciannilli, who works at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, says many people still remember where they were when Challenger exploded. For them, it was a life-changing moment, much like the assassination of President Kennedy."

        "gpt": "BALTIMORE—Signs of spring, like frogs, toads, and salamanders, are disappearing quickly in the United States, says a new study.\n\nScientists from the U.S. Geological Survey and some universities studied these animals and found their numbers dropping faster and in more places than expected. Even common species, like Maryland's spring peepers, are struggling. These animals are also vanishing from protected areas like national parks and wildlife refuges.\n\nEvan Grant, a scientist who studies amphibians, said the findings were surprising. If this continues, rare species could disappear from half of their current homes in just six years. Common species might face similar losses in about 26 years.\n\nScientists have known for a while that some frogs, toads, and salamanders were in trouble. But this is the first big study to show how fast they are disappearing across the country.\n\nAmphibians are important. They eat mosquitoes and other pests. They also help scientists understand changes in the environment because they live in both water and on land. They breathe through their skin, which makes them sensitive to changes in water quality.\n\n\"Amphibians show us what’s happening in the environment,\" said Joel Snodgrass, a biology professor at Towson University. He has seen fewer amphibians locally, mostly because development has destroyed or changed their homes. He said the study is useful because it looked at many places over a long time.\n\nThe study checked 48 species at nearly three dozen sites across the U.S. over nine years. Researchers found fewer amphibians in their usual homes each year. On average, the number of places where they were found dropped by 3.7% every year. If this keeps up, they could be in half as many places in just 20 years.\n\nMichael Adams, the lead researcher, said they don’t know how long this has been happening or if it will continue. The study didn’t identify clear causes for the decline. However, past research has linked amphibian losses to development, disease, pollution, climate change, and new species moving in. A fungus killing frogs in other countries is found in the U.S., but no clear link has been made yet.\n\nThe study focused on protected areas, so development likely wasn’t the main problem. \"Seeing declines even in protected areas shows there’s a bigger issue affecting amphibians,\" said Grant.\n\nThe researchers noted that droughts during the study might have reduced water in wetlands and ponds, affecting amphibians.\n\nIn Maryland, state experts haven’t seen big drops in most frogs, toads, and salamanders over the past 20 years. However, some salamanders sensitive to changes in water and land have declined. Urban development, like in Baltimore, has also hurt amphibians. Salt used to melt ice on roads can harm the insects they eat and affect the amphibians directly. Salt changes the water, and because amphibians breathe through their skin, it can make them lose water from their bodies and die.\n\n\"They basically die of thirst, even in water,\" Snodgrass explained."

He answered, \"Jonathan Martin.\"\n\nThe relationship between the two teammates took a bad turn on Monday. It was revealed that Incognito sent racist and threatening text messages to Martin, according to two people familiar with the situation. These people spoke anonymously because the Dolphins and the NFL have not shared details about the incident. \n\nIncognito, known for playing aggressively, was suspended on Sunday. Martin, who left the team last week due to emotional struggles, missed practice again on Monday. Martin is now in Los Angeles with his family, receiving counseling.\n\nIncognito, who weighs 319 pounds, is a white player in his ninth NFL season. Martin, who weighs 312 pounds, is a Black player in his second season. The two linemen played side by side for much of the season.\n\nThe Dolphins and the NFL are investigating claims from Martin's representatives that he was bullied. Dolphins owner Stephen Ross asked NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell for help, and the NFL Players Association is also looking into the matter.\n\nDolphins coach Joe Philbin said, \"Any behavior that harms our team's goal of reaching full potential is not okay and won't be allowed.\" However, it’s unclear if the team’s coaches or management knew about the harassment before Martin left. There have also been complaints that younger players are pressured to pay more than their share when the team goes out together.\n\nAfter winning against Cincinnati last Thursday, the Dolphins had a few days off, during which the Martin story grew. When the players returned to practice on Monday, they found a swarm of reporters in their locker room.\n\nSome teammates spoke kindly about both Martin and Incognito. Receiver Mike Wallace said, \"The only problem is we can’t even get dressed with all these reporters.\" Wallace described Incognito as intense but a good teammate. New player Bryant McKinnie said Incognito often made people laugh. \n\nHazing of young players has been common in sports, but Incognito’s actions toward Martin raised concerns about whether coaches or teammates should have stepped in. Tennessee Titans player Jason McCourty said, \"It’s clear what’s right and wrong. Someone should have stopped it before it got this bad.\"\n\nArizona Cardinals player Darnell Dockett said he was glad the Dolphins suspended Incognito. \"Bullying someone is classless,\" Dockett said. \"It’s worse when you hurt someone mentally. That can be harder than physical pain.\"\n\nIncognito has a history of bad behavior. On the HBO show \"Hard Knocks,\" which followed the Dolphins in 2012, Incognito was shown hacking into a teammate's Facebook account. Philbin said he didn’t watch the show and didn’t know about the incident. He promised to make the team environment safe if the investigation finds it wasn’t.\n\nBefore his suspension, Incognito posted tweets defending himself. He quoted Buddha, saying, \"The sun, the moon, and the truth cannot be hidden for long.\"\n\nIncognito, in the final year of a $13 million contract, has been called one of the NFL’s dirtiest players. During his first four years, he led the league in penalties for rough play. The St. Louis Rams released him in 2009 for his behavior. Despite this, Incognito had fewer complaints since joining the Dolphins in 2010. Last year, he was voted into the Pro Bowl and won the Dolphins' \"Good Guy Award.\" Teammates even chose him for the team’s player council.\n\nIncognito’s problems stretch back to college. He was suspended in 2004 after a fight with a teammate at Nebraska, where he also had legal issues and broke team rules.\n\nMartin, on the other hand, was a top player at Stanford, protecting quarterback Andrew Luck. He joined the Dolphins in 2012 as a second-round draft pick and has been a starter since. However, he has struggled with his performance in the NFL. Stanford coach David Shaw said Martin is working on himself and hopes to return to football.\n\nFor much of this season, Incognito and Martin worked together to protect Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill. Their rocky relationship might explain why Tannehill has been sacked more than any other quarterback this year."

        "gpt": "LOS ANGELES — NASA is planning to send astronauts to an asteroid or even Mars in the future. These trips could last more than 30 days. But there’s a big challenge: How should NASA handle the health risks astronauts might face on these long missions?\n\nTo figure this out, NASA asked a group of experts to create guidelines. They worked together and shared their ideas in a 187-page report released on Wednesday.\n\nThe report, led by Jeffrey Kahn from Johns Hopkins University, says that long missions, like staying on the International Space Station (ISS) or going to Mars, will likely expose astronauts to serious health risks. Some risks are already known, like radiation that can cause cancer or bone loss from being in zero gravity too long. Others, like unexpected problems from space radiation or stress in small spaces, are harder to predict.\n\nHere are some of the risks astronauts might face:\n- Cancer from radiation\n- Weak bones from no gravity\n- Feeling sick or tired after a solar storm\n- Blurry vision\n- Mental stress from living in tight spaces for a long time\n\nThe report gave some advice:\n- NASA should try to reduce risks as much as possible.\n- Missions should only happen if the benefits are greater than the risks.\n- NASA should be honest about the risks and share all information with astronauts.\n- NASA should act responsibly and make fair decisions.\n\nRight now, astronauts on long trips might face risks that go beyond NASA’s current safety rules. For example, a study found that the radiation astronauts would be exposed to during a round trip to Mars might go over today’s safety limits. To solve this, scientists might need to find ways to make the trip shorter or the spacecraft safer. Or, NASA might need to rethink how much risk is okay.\n\nBut the experts in the report said NASA shouldn’t simply lower its safety standards for long missions. Instead, they suggest making exceptions for specific missions, but only after careful review. Each mission would need to be studied on its own.\n\nThe experts also said NASA should:\n- Provide astronauts with lifetime health care.\n- Understand that every astronaut might face different risks.\n- Collect health data from astronauts while protecting their privacy.\n\nThe report reminds us that space travel has always been risky. From the start, astronauts have faced dangers to their health and safety. But with the right plans and care, NASA can keep exploring while protecting its crew."

        "gpt": "GROVELAND, Calif. — The Rim Fire burned a large area of forest in the Sierra Nevada. It also damaged the homes of some of California's rarest animals, like the great gray owl, the Sierra Nevada red fox, and the Pacific fisher.\n\nThe fire destroyed 257,000 acres in the Stanislaus National Forest and Yosemite National Park. This area is home to about 200 great gray owls, which are a special group different from others in the world.\n\nThe fire came close to where 10 pairs of Sierra Nevada red foxes live. These foxes survive in cold, steep areas above the tree line. Scientists worry that some foxes may have been killed by coyotes fleeing the fire. These foxes were thought to be extinct in the 1920s, but they were rediscovered in 2010. They might soon be added to the Endangered Species List.\n\nThe fire also harmed the habitat of the Pacific fisher, a small animal related to weasels. About 500 Pacific fishers live in old forests south of Yosemite. They are also being considered for the Endangered Species List.\n\nJohn Buckley, head of a local environmental group, said many animals could not escape the fire. \"Only the fastest birds and animals survived,\" he said. \"It killed squirrels and bears. For rare animals, this could be a disaster.\"\n\nScientists won't know how many animals died until they can explore the burned areas. But these areas might stay closed for over a year for safety reasons.\n\nEven without full information, federal agencies are making plans to help wildlife recover. This includes planting trees and removing burned wood. However, these efforts were delayed by a government shutdown.\n\nEarly reports show that the fire destroyed many nesting spots for spotted owls, goshawks, and great gray owls. The great gray owl is the largest owl in North America, standing 2 feet tall with a 5-foot wingspan.\n\nRoy Bridgman, a wildlife biologist, said the loss of even one great gray owl nest is a big problem. \"I visited a nest that had been there for 20 years, and it was gone,\" he said.\n\nDespite the damage, there is some hope. John Keane, another wildlife biologist, has studied great gray owls for 15 years. He recently visited a meadow near Yosemite that was not burned. \"If I had to guess, I'd say there are still owls here,\" he said.\n\nMore research is needed to see if enough owls survived to keep the population alive.\n\nTwo months after the fire, animals are still searching for food and shelter. Some, like bobcats and mountain lions, have been seen hunting near tourist areas. Lill Mcleod, who works at a local store, said many animals are starving. She described finding an injured bear with burns and a broken paw. The bear was so hurt it had to be put down, along with an injured cub found later.\n\nCommon animals like bears and deer are expected to recover. But the future is less certain for the black-backed woodpecker, which might also be added to the Endangered Species List. This bird helps forests recover after fires by making nesting holes for other animals. However, it is threatened by logging, as workers are cutting down burned trees to clear roads and collect timber.\n\nBiologists and loggers are trying to balance helping wildlife and salvaging resources. \"We're looking for silver linings,\" Bridgman said, \"but it's a tough situation.\""

        "gpt": "LONDON – In October, China announced it would end its one-child policy, which had been in place for 37 years. This policy sped up the aging of China's population. It also caused big changes in society and the economy. Now, China will allow families to have two children. The question is how much this will help fix the problems caused by the one-child rule.\n\nThe two-child policy will likely have big effects, and overall, it will be more positive than the one-child rule. These effects will be felt in both the short and long term. One important result is that families with more children will save less money. This is a goal China has wanted to achieve for a long time.\n\nChina’s savings rate is very high. Many believe it causes problems for the global economy, like low interest rates. It also makes it harder for China to shift from an economy based on exports to one focused on spending and services. The two-child policy could help speed up this shift.\n\nEconomists have studied how the one-child policy changed China’s population. From 1970 to 2010, the number of young people under 20 dropped from 51% to 27%. At the same time, the number of people aged 60 and older rose from 7% to 14%. This made the average age in China rise from 20 to 35 years.\n\nAs more people retire, there will be fewer young workers to support them. In the future, each person from the one-child generation will need to take care of two older people. When the two-child generation grows up, they will only need to support one elderly person each. This will reduce the pressure on workers, but it will take decades to happen. For now, the one-child generation will need to care for both older people and more children.\n\nThis will be hard for the one-child generation, but it will also lead to more spending. Families will need to buy more, which will boost the economy. Studies show that families with twins under the one-child policy spent more than those with only one child. \n\nIn 2009, urban families with two children saved about 12.8% of their income, while families with one child saved 21.3%. This pattern was seen across all income levels. With more children, families will spend more on things like books, toys, and bicycles. Later, as these children grow, there will be more demand for housing, insurance, and medicine.\n\nEducation spending will also increase. In 2009, one-child families spent about 10.6% of their income on education. Families with twins spent 17.3%. As more families have two children, the overall savings rate in China could drop by 7-10 percentage points in the next 10 years.\n\nHowever, there is a downside. Families with more children may spend less on each child’s education. This could lead to lower levels of learning. For example, twins are 40% more likely to go to vocational high schools than only children, as they get less support after age 15.\n\nEven with these challenges, the two-child policy is an important change. It will help balance China’s aging population and could lead to more stable economic growth in the future, despite some difficulties during the transition."

        "gpt": "Many people have compared the current debates about Syrians seeking safety in the U.S. to the struggles of European Jews who tried to escape Nazi rule before World War II.  \n\nOne well-known family that failed to escape was Otto Frank’s family. Otto, his wife Edith, and their daughters Margot and Anne tried to flee Nazi persecution but couldn’t. Their story, though tragic, was similar to what many other Jews faced. In 2007, historian Richard Breitman wrote about this when new documents were found showing the Franks’ efforts to get U.S. visas.  \n\nBreitman explained that Otto Frank’s attempts to move his family to the U.S. were blocked by strict American immigration rules. These rules were meant to limit foreigners entering the country during the war. Breitman told NPR that if things had been different, Anne Frank might have grown up to be a writer living in Boston. Instead, she died at age 15 in a Nazi concentration camp.  \n\nOtto Frank applied for U.S. visas too late. He faced a long, complicated process, as shown in nearly 80 pages of documents found by the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research. Even Otto’s powerful connections in America couldn’t help.  \n\nThe process involved many letters and documents, but progress was slow. The New York Times described how each step brought new challenges. The family needed sponsors, money, and proof that they wouldn’t be a burden to the U.S. Whenever one problem was solved, another appeared.  \n\nBy 1941, the Frank family had already moved from Germany to the Netherlands. Otto applied for U.S. visas, but their applications were destroyed. In a letter to his friend Nathan Straus Jr., Otto explained how desperate he was to leave, especially for the sake of his two daughters. He asked Straus for $5,000 to help with the visa process.  \n\nStraus, a well-connected man, and his wife tried to help. Edith Frank’s brothers in the U.S. also offered support. But Otto worried they didn’t have enough money to convince immigration officials. Their employer eventually submitted documents to help, but it wasn’t enough.  \n\nHistorians believe Otto might have had better chances if he had tried earlier. At first, the family’s life in the Netherlands seemed manageable under Nazi rule. Otto hesitated to leave because moving to a new country seemed uncertain and risky.  \n\nLater, a blackmail threat from a Nazi supporter pushed Otto to try again for visas. But by then, U.S. immigration rules had become stricter. Suspicion of European immigrants was growing in America, and the Nazis were also making it harder for Jews to leave.  \n\nBy 1939, over 300,000 people were waiting for U.S. visas. New rules required immigrants to secure transportation before getting a visa. By 1941, many U.S. consulates in Nazi-occupied areas had closed, forcing people to apply in other countries like Spain or Portugal.  \n\nThe U.S. also introduced rules that banned visas for families with close relatives still in Germany. Officials worried that Nazis could use these relatives to force refugees to spy on America. All members of the Frank family needed visas at the same time, or none could go.  \n\nWhen U.S. rules made visas nearly impossible, Otto turned to Cuba as a possible refuge. Some Jews managed to get into Cuba while waiting for U.S. visas, but even Cuba tightened its immigration policies. Otto wrote to Straus about this option, and despite the high costs, he managed to get a Cuban visa for himself in December 1941.  \n\nHowever, ten days later, Germany and Italy declared war on the U.S., and Otto’s Cuban visa was canceled. In 1942, the Frank family went into hiding after Margot received an order to report to a Nazi labor camp. A month earlier, Anne had received the diary she would later make famous.  \n\nThe family was eventually discovered and sent to concentration camps. Anne and Margot died of typhus, and Edith died of starvation. Otto was the only survivor.  \n\nIn 1946, Edith’s brother asked about the family’s fate. He learned that Otto had survived and returned to Amsterdam, five years after first trying to get his family to safety in the U.S.  \n\nAnne Frank’s diary, written while in hiding, captured the pain and hope of millions of Jews. In 1944, she wrote, “It’s difficult in times like these: ideals, dreams, and hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.”"

        "gpt": "WASHINGTON — Many people might not notice the partial government shutdown on Tuesday, but it will affect federal workers, contractors, and people who use government services.\n\nAround 800,000 federal workers will be sent home without pay. They won’t get paid until a new deal is reached to fund the government.\n\nThe House and Senate couldn’t agree on a budget plan last night. This means some government services will stop, while others will continue.\n\nFor example, the State Department will stop processing some passport applications in certain offices. This could disrupt travel plans for people who need passports.\n\nThe Treasury Department will pause work on financial crimes like money laundering. However, air traffic control services will continue, so flights won’t be affected. Amtrak trains will also keep running.\n\nEven though some services will continue, many workers will be sent home. At the Department of Transportation, about one-third of employees will be furloughed. While accident investigations and airport planning will go on, things like employee drug testing and security checks will stop.\n\nFor the military, soldiers will still get paid, but there could be delays if the shutdown lasts a long time. Emergency services like police and fire will continue, but around half of the Pentagon’s civilian workers will stay home. Training and non-essential maintenance will also pause.\n\nVeterans can still get medical care at VA hospitals and clinics. Claims and pensions will also continue. However, some support services, like hotlines for veterans, won’t be available.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security will furlough over 30,000 workers, but critical jobs like border patrol and airport security will continue.\n\nMuseums and national parks will close or operate with very few staff. This means school groups, like a class from Illinois visiting Washington, D.C., will face canceled plans.\n\nHere’s how the shutdown will affect some services:\n\n- **Social Security**: Payments will continue, and offices will stay open. But new Social Security cards and proof-of-income letters won’t be issued.\n- **Medicare**: Services will continue, but payments to doctors and hospitals could be delayed if the shutdown lasts long.\n- **IRS**: Tax refunds won’t be processed, but electronic returns can still be filed.\n- **Education**: Most federal education money has already been spent for the school year. However, some Head Start programs for preschoolers might run out of funds.\n- **Post Office**: Mail delivery and post offices won’t be affected because they don’t rely on government funding.\n- **NASA**: Most of NASA will shut down, except for support to astronauts on the space station.\n\nMuseums like the Smithsonian and the National Zoo in Washington will close, along with presidential libraries and parks like Yellowstone. Visitors to national parks will have 48 hours to leave. Even the Statue of Liberty and Independence Hall will close.\n\nFor tourists, this shutdown will be noticeable. People with planned trips, weddings, or honeymoons at places like Yellowstone are now unsure what to do.\n\nThis shutdown is causing confusion and frustration for many people, from workers to travelers."

        "gpt": "BALTIMORE — Professor James Gates uses simple comparisons to explain big ideas.  \n\nHe says lowering science standards in schools is like teaching kids to score on a basketball hoop that's 9 feet high while others play with a 10-foot hoop.  \n\nGates believes having different perspectives in science is important. Without it, you’d only get one type of music, like classical. But with diversity, you get rock 'n' roll and jazz. He even has his own unique way of looking at math.  \n\nAt the University of Maryland, College Park, Gates works on making hard math easier to understand. He turns complicated equations into simple pictures and diagrams to help others learn about tiny particles in physics.  \n\nGates is a leader in a branch of physics called supersymmetry. He’s also great at explaining it to others. Because of this, he’s on Maryland’s school board and the President’s Council of Advisers on Science and Technology. He’s won many awards, like the National Medal of Science and was named Scientist of the Year by Harvard.  \n\nGates is well-known for a physicist. In a PBS video, he explains string theory in just 30 seconds.  \n\nWhile working on his own research, Gates also helps young scientists prepare to continue his work. His colleague, Jogesh Pati, says Gates is one of the few scientists who shares his knowledge with the public so clearly.  \n\nGates’ work focuses on making hard ideas simple. Supersymmetry tries to combine two major physics ideas: Einstein’s theory of relativity, which explains gravity and space, and quantum mechanics, which explains tiny particles like atoms.  \n\nGates, now 63, became interested in science as a boy after watching a space movie and reading a book about space travel. He even came close to becoming an astronaut. After losing his mother as a teen, he started asking deep questions about life and studied world religions. By age 16, he felt he had found his answers.  \n\nAt the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Gates wrote the first thesis on supersymmetry. A professor there praised it as the best defense of a thesis he’d ever seen.  \n\nGates’ ability to explain ideas clearly sets him apart. He sees science in a visual way, which helps others understand it better, says Martin Rocek, a fellow physicist.  \n\nIn 1979, Gates worked with another scientist, Warren Siegel, on a key paper. Siegel had great ideas, but no one understood them. Gates helped make them clear, and their work became widely cited.  \n\nGates joined the University of Maryland in 1984. He discovered his love for teaching while tutoring students at MIT. He enjoys seeing students’ faces light up when they understand something new.  \n\nHis teaching style is praised for connecting big ideas. For example, he explains quantum mechanics by linking it to Newton’s physics, even though they are very different.  \n\nGates also works to improve education for all children. In 2009, he joined Maryland’s school board to help improve science teaching. He supports changes like the Common Core and new national science standards.  \n\nHe believes all students should have the same chances he had, even if they come from underprivileged backgrounds. He’s focused on making sure all students succeed, not just some.  \n\nGates also brings science to the public. In a PBS series, he explains string theory in half a minute. He says his goal is to do something meaningful for humanity through science.  \n\nIn 2012, Gates gained attention for finding a pattern in physics equations that looked like computer code. He joked about living in a simulation, like in the movie *The Matrix*.  \n\nWhile some scientists didn’t agree with this idea, Gates continues to push boundaries. The Harvard Foundation honored him for both his research and his efforts to teach science to everyone.  \n\nGates admits he’s a bit different from most scientists. “I like to say I’m slightly crazy,” he jokes.

Their schools are on strike because of government funding cuts. People say these cuts are unfair and target the Arab minority.\n\nChristian schools, which serve both Christian and Muslim Arab students, say the government is trying to push them into the public school system. They believe this would harm their Christian values and hurt their strong academic results.\n\nIn the city of Ramle, the three Khoury children are spending their days at home while their parents wait for news. Talks are ongoing between the Education Ministry and the schools. About 33,000 students in 47 Christian schools have been on strike since September 1.\n\n\"I wake up late every day, watch TV, and play. There’s not much else to do,\" said 13-year-old Bashar.\n\n\"I miss my friends and teachers. I miss going to school,\" said 10-year-old Loucin, who should be in fourth grade this year.\n\nChristian and other private schools in Israel run their own programs. The government gives them some money, but they also depend on donations and tuition fees. The government covers about three-quarters of their basic costs, but it has been cutting other types of funding. \n\nPeople say these cuts are unfair to Arab citizens, who make up about 20% of Israel’s population. They point out that the government fully funds two large private school networks for ultra-Orthodox Jewish students. Because of the cuts, Christian schools have had to raise tuition, which is hard for families with low incomes.\n\n\"The government is treating minorities unfairly. It treats Jewish people differently from us,\" said Khader Khoury, the father of the three children.\n\n\"We just want our kids to go back to school. They’ve been home for 21 days, bored, not learning, and feeling down. But we will continue the strike until we get what we deserve,\" he added.\n\nThe community has also held protests. Earlier this month, 2,500 people marched outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office in Jerusalem.\n\nThe Education Ministry says it has held important meetings with Christian leaders to solve the problem. But it claims the leaders have refused its offers.\n\nWadie Abu Nasser, an adviser to the Catholic Church, said the talks are difficult but happening in a \"positive\" way. He hopes for a fair solution.\n\nChristians make up less than 2% of the population in Israel and the Palestinian territories. There are about 150,000 Christian citizens in Israel and 50,000 in east Jerusalem, the West Bank, and Gaza. \n\nUnlike other places in the Middle East, Christians in Israel have not faced extreme violence. But many say they deal with unfair treatment in things like housing and jobs. Over the years, many have left the region to find better opportunities."

This change shows the government is worried about its aging population and fewer workers, which could hurt the economy in the future.\n\nThe decision was made after a meeting of China’s Communist Party leaders. However, Xinhua did not say when the new rule would start. China first introduced the one-child policy in 1980, but it was slightly relaxed in 2013.\n\nExperts like Wang Feng from the University of California say China is facing a big problem with its population. He warned that the country is getting older quickly, which could lead to fewer workers and more pressure on the economy. This could even cause challenges for the Communist Party.\n\nChina’s fertility rate is very low at 1.4 children per woman. This is much lower than in countries like the United States. Fewer children mean fewer young workers and more elderly people needing care, which puts stress on the country’s resources and economy.\n\nExperts believe letting families have two children will not fix these problems right away. Wang Feng said the change is \"great news,\" but it will take many years to make a real difference. He also said the one-child policy caused serious problems that China will deal with for a long time.\n\nChina’s working population has been shrinking. In 2014, it dropped by 3.7 million people to 916 million. At the same time, the number of elderly people is growing fast. By the early 2030s, about one-fourth of the population will be over 60 years old, according to United Nations predictions.\n\nThe one-child policy had already been eased before. Families were allowed a second child if one parent was an only child. Rural families could also have a second child if their first child was a girl. But these changes did not lead to many more births, as many families chose to stick with one child because of costs and cultural reasons."

        "gpt": "CHICAGO — President Barack Obama is expected to choose the location for his library soon, but people in Chicago are arguing over a plan to put it in a public park. This isn’t the first time a presidential library has caused disagreements over land.\n\nIn Texas, people from College Station fought Texas A&M University when the school planned to move a pig farm to make space for the George H.W. Bush library. In Atlanta, Georgia, residents protested to stop a road being built through a park for Jimmy Carter’s library. In Little Rock, Arkansas, old warehouses where homeless people stayed were torn down to make way for Bill Clinton’s library.\n\nNow, the University of Chicago wants to build Obama’s library on 20 acres in either Washington Park or Jackson Park on the South Side. Last week, the Chicago Park District approved a plan to let the city take control of parkland if the university wins the bid to host the library.\n\n“It’s not easy to find the right land and make everything work,” said Benjamin Hufbauer, a professor and expert on presidential libraries. He explained that land disagreements often happen with these projects. Sometimes, deals are made quickly, but other times, the fights end up in court, delaying construction.\n\nPresidents usually stay out of these arguments, but they have the final say on whether to keep fighting or give up. “Presidents don’t like controversy. It doesn’t help them,” Hufbauer said.\n\nThe last two presidential libraries, for Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, faced long legal battles over land. For Bush’s library, Southern Methodist University (SMU) in Dallas had trouble with neighbors. SMU quietly bought land near its campus, but one condo owner refused to sell. After years of court fights, the city took the land for SMU, and the condos were torn down for the library.\n\nLike SMU, the University of Chicago doesn’t have enough space on its own property. The university has been buying land near Washington Park for years but says the largest lot it owns, 6 acres, is too small for a modern library. Clinton’s library is on 38 acres, and Bush’s is on 23 acres. The university is also offering 5 more acres owned by the city and the transit authority.\n\nIf the university wins, the library would use 3 to 5 acres of parkland, and the rest of the park would stay open to the public. The Obamas would then choose between Washington Park and Jackson Park for the library.\n\nSome people, like park preservationists, oppose the plan and may sue to stop it. Others, including local residents, support it because they believe it will bring jobs and money to the area. The University of Chicago’s plan has also drawn attention to its competition, including Columbia University in New York, the University of Illinois at Chicago, and the University of Hawaii in Honolulu.\n\nLast week, the Chicago Park District agreed to transfer 20 acres of parkland to the city if the University of Chicago is chosen. The land would be leased to the Barack Obama Foundation to build the library. If the university doesn’t win, the parkland would stay under the Park District’s control.\n\nEven though the parkland wouldn’t be owned by the university, preservationists are still worried. Cassandra Francis, head of Chicago’s Friends of the Parks, said that long leases can sometimes be treated as permanent land transfers under the law.\n\nArguments over presidential libraries have happened before. In Little Rock, officials spent five years in court trying to get land for Clinton’s library. The city claimed the land would be used as a park, but it was really for the library. Homeless people who stayed in old warehouses there were displaced when the buildings were torn down.\n\nIn Atlanta, Jimmy Carter’s library caused protests when a road was planned through a historic park. Residents protested by climbing trees and blocking construction equipment. After 12 years of court fights, the road was built but didn’t go through the park as originally planned.\n\nIn Texas, residents complained when Texas A&M planned to move 800 pigs to a low-income area to make room for Bush’s library. Locals worried about bad smells and pollution. The university eventually chose a different location for the pigs, and the library was built on the original site.\n\nRonald Reagan’s library also faced problems. It was first planned for Stanford University near San Francisco, but locals and students didn’t want it because of traffic and environmental concerns. After years of delays, Reagan moved the project to Simi Valley in Southern California, where he still faced opposition over traffic, air quality, and rare plants.\n\nEven John F. Kennedy’s library had to change locations. It was supposed to be near Harvard University, but neighbors and environmental groups opposed it. The library was eventually built in a less crowded area of Boston.\n\nThese examples show that building presidential libraries often leads to disagreements over land, parks, and neighborhoods."

        "gpt": "SHANGHAI — Christopher St. Cavish, a former chef turned food writer, stopped outside the Welcome Revered Guests restaurant. \"They don’t like me here,\" he said with a frown. \n\nIt’s not because he gave the restaurant a bad review. In fact, he gave it the highest rating. The staff is upset because of the way he judged their famous soup dumplings, called *xiao long bao*, a classic Shanghai snack.\n\nOn his last visit, St. Cavish ordered nine baskets of dumplings. Then, instead of eating them, he spent an hour carefully measuring them. He used tools like an electronic scale, calipers, and scissors to analyze the dumplings. After all that, he only ate two dumplings and packed the rest to go.\n\nSt. Cavish has visited many restaurants in Shanghai, measuring the dumplings’ thin skin, the amount of soup, and the weight of the pork filling. He even studied how the dumplings change as they cool after being steamed. All this data was used to create the \"Shanghai Soup Dumpling Index,\" which ranks the city’s dumplings. Welcome Revered Guests, known as Zun Ke Lai in Mandarin, earned the top spot.\n\n*Xiao long bao* are a beloved food in Shanghai, eaten at any time of day. They are so important that the Shanghai government calls them a \"protected traditional treasure.\" People argue about which restaurant makes the best dumplings, not just in Shanghai but also in places like Hong Kong, Taipei, and California.\n\nSt. Cavish, a 34-year-old from South Florida, worked as a chef in the U.S. for ten years before moving to China in 2005. Since 2013, he has visited 52 different restaurants in Shanghai to find the best dumplings.\n\nThe staff at Zun Ke Lai, however, didn’t appreciate his thorough testing. When St. Cavish told one of the workers that their dumplings ranked first, she didn’t seem impressed. \"She looked at me like I had told her I had a toenail problem,\" he joked.\n\nDespite the restaurant’s annoyance, St. Cavish’s dumpling index has gained attention in China. His detailed study of dumplings has surprised many in a country where food is often seen as an art, not a science. News outlets have praised his work, and he even created a bilingual chart that explains his rankings with diagrams and measurements.\n\nThe *Guangzhou Daily* newspaper admired his persistence, saying, \"He achieved his dream through hard work and dedication.\"\n\nInterestingly, St. Cavish didn’t have a background in science before moving to China. He had never even eaten *xiao long bao* before. Now, he says they aren’t even his favorite food, and he doesn’t make them at home. \"I’m not obsessed with them,\" he explained. \"They’re just a way for me to explore ideas about food and writing.\"\n\nOne reason he created the index was to defend *xiao long bao* made by Din Tai Fung, a famous dumpling chain. Some locals think Din Tai Fung’s dumplings are not authentic because the company is based in Taiwan. St. Cavish, however, likes their precise recipe, which includes 18 folds in the dumpling skin—no more, no less.\n\nSt. Cavish also wanted to find a new way to write about food. \"Most food writing is subjective,\" he said. \"It was freeing to focus on measurements instead of personal opinions.\"\n\n*Xiao long bao* were a good choice for his experiment because their quality can be measured. The thin skin, the amount of soup, and the filling can all be calculated. However, he didn’t measure taste, as it would require expensive tools. Instead, he avoided dumplings with too much MSG.\n\nAt Zun Ke Lai, the dumpling skins are just 0.72 millimeters thick, and the filling makes up 46% of their weight. When asked how they achieve this, the manager simply said, \"That’s a trade secret.\"\n\nSt. Cavish divided the 52 restaurants he studied into three groups: Class A (the best), Class B (average), and Class C (poor). Zun Ke Lai ranked first with a score of 24.32, while Din Tai Fung came in seventh with 13.86.\n\nSome chefs in Shanghai are now experimenting with fancy dumplings, using colorful skins and unique fillings. Food writer Crystyl Mo said the index is an \"interesting way\" to look at a classic Shanghai dish. \"It might not show the most delicious dumpling, but it’s definitely the most technically perfect,\" she said.\n\nSt. Cavish knows his project is a bit unusual. \"It’s a funny experiment,\" he said. \"I don’t want people to take it too seriously.\" Still, he believes the index helps people think more deeply about what makes food enjoyable.\n\n\"As a food writer, my job is to explain why something is good or not,\" he said. \"I’m not sure if dumplings have gained anything from this, but I know I have.\""

        "gpt": "KENOSHA, Wis. — Near Lake Michigan, the Civil War feels alive again. Cannons roar, smoke covers a battlefield, and men wearing blue and gray uniforms charge at each other.\n\nThe Civil War was a time when Americans fought against each other—brother against brother, neighbor against neighbor. It was North versus South. When the war ended, many thousands were dead or injured. Only the soldiers who fought knew what the battles felt like, but after the war, artists began painting huge scenes of the fighting. These paintings, called cycloramas, let people imagine what the war was like.\n\nNow, the Civil War Museum in Kenosha has created a modern version of these cycloramas. Using tall screens and 360-degree technology, the museum shows an 11-minute movie called *\"Seeing the Elephant.\"*\n\nThe movie was filmed last summer at Old World Wisconsin with 200 people acting as Civil War soldiers. It tells the story of three men who join the Union Army for different reasons and then go to battle.\n\nDoug Dammann, the museum’s curator, said, “We wanted to make a film that feels like you’re in the middle of the action, like a living cyclorama.”\n\nCycloramas were very popular in the late 1800s. These large paintings showed battle scenes and were first made in Europe. They came to the U.S. in the 1880s, with many artists painting Civil War battles. Milwaukee became a center for cyclorama art, thanks to companies like American Panorama Co. and Northwestern Panorama Co.\n\nSome cycloramas still exist today, like one in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, and another in Atlanta, Georgia. The Atlanta cyclorama was painted with help from Union and Confederate veterans and a war illustrator. It was made by Milwaukee artists and is still on display in Atlanta.\n\n“In the days before movies and TV, cycloramas helped people imagine what battles like Gettysburg were like,” Dammann said.\n\nWhen the Kenosha museum opened in 2008, they planned to add a cyclorama someday. Last year, they started work on the $1 million movie, funded by private donations. A Boston film company was hired, and Civil War re-enactors from the Midwest and beyond were invited to join. Old World Wisconsin, with its historic buildings, was selected as the filming location.\n\nDirector Bob Noll said, “Everywhere you look, it feels like the past. It’s perfect for filming.”\n\nA special camera with nine lenses was used to film the battles. The crew carefully planned the scenes, using flags to mark where cannon explosions and pyrotechnics would go. Actors were guided by a coordinator to make the fighting look real.\n\nThe movie’s battle isn’t based on a specific event, but it’s inspired by something that happened before the Second Battle of Bull Run. Lance Herdegen, a local historian, helped write the script and even acted in the movie as a newspaper editor. He explained that creating a real battle could lead to criticism from experts over small details, like the placement of a fence.\n\nThe dialogue in the movie comes from real letters and journals written by Civil War soldiers, Herdegen said.\n\nAt the museum, visitors stand on a platform with railings and can turn around to see the action all around them. The theater uses eight projectors, multiple speakers, and special lights to make the experience feel real.\n\nThe movie’s name, *\"Seeing the Elephant,\"* comes from a phrase Civil War soldiers used to describe their first time in battle."

        "gpt": "When a virus spreads from one person to another, it can change and sometimes become more dangerous. Scientists are still unsure if this has happened with the Ebola virus spreading in West Africa. So far, there is no strong evidence that this strain of Ebola is more deadly or easier to spread than earlier outbreaks in Africa. Scientists are still studying this question.\n\nOne thing scientists do know is that this Ebola virus is not changing very quickly. Earlier studies suggested it was mutating faster than before, but new research shows it is not evolving at a speed that would ruin the vaccines and treatments being developed.\n\nStudying how fast the virus changes is important. Scientists need to understand the virus as it is now to create treatments and vaccines that work. If the virus changes too much, the medicines and vaccines might stop working. The new research, published in the journal *Science*, gives hope that current efforts will still be effective.\n\nIn this study, scientists looked at the full genetic code of the virus from different times and places in West Africa during 2014. They compared samples from Guinea in March, Sierra Leone in June, and Mali in October and November. They found only small differences between the samples, even though the virus had spread between many people over several months. The mutation rate of this Ebola strain is similar to past outbreaks in Central Africa.\n\nThe study provides a clearer picture of how the virus has changed over time. Lead researcher Heinz Feldmann, a virus expert, explained that earlier studies suggested the virus was mutating faster, but this new research shows that is not the case. Some changes seen in earlier studies may have disappeared over time. The good news is that vaccines and treatments are more likely to work, but more studies are needed to confirm this.\n\nAnother study, also published on March 26 in *Science*, tested a possible Ebola vaccine on monkeys. It showed promising results. The vaccine, made from a killed version of the virus, protected the monkeys from getting sick. Even after being treated with extra safety measures, the vaccine still worked. Scientists hope this vaccine could help humans, but it is not yet clear how it compares to other vaccines already being tested.\n\nScientists warn that even though the virus is mutating slowly, a few key changes could still make vaccines less effective. It is important to develop multiple vaccines and treatments to prepare for future Ebola outbreaks. Keiji Fukuda, a health expert at the World Health Organization (WHO), says having several safe and effective options will be crucial because Ebola is likely to return in the future.\n\nAs the current outbreak slows, researchers and global health leaders are thinking about how to better handle future outbreaks. In March, experts met at a conference to discuss how to improve health systems, raise funds, and involve private companies in fighting diseases like Ebola. They plan to publish a report with their ideas later in 2015.\n\nEbola cases have decreased in West Africa. In the week of March 22, only 79 new cases were reported, the lowest number in 2015 so far. However, the virus is still spreading in parts of Sierra Leone and Guinea, and a new case was found in Liberia, delaying hopes of declaring the country Ebola-free.\n\nAs the outbreak fades, some worry that the world will forget about Ebola. Fukuda warns that this would be a mistake because the virus could return. He believes the world must stay prepared to fight Ebola in the future."

        "gpt": "LAS VEGAS — When people hear \"virtual reality\" (VR), they often think of video games. You put on a VR headset, and suddenly you're in a spaceship, driving a race car, or dodging bullets like in \"The Matrix.\" It sounds exciting, but VR isn't quite ready yet. The headsets are still big and awkward, and fast-moving games can make users feel sick.\n\nWhile fixing these problems, VR companies like Oculus, which Facebook bought for $2 billion, are looking for other ways to use VR. At a tech show in Las Vegas, people who tried the Oculus Rift headset got to experience different VR scenes. They saw a scary T-Rex at a museum and felt like they were at the top of a skyscraper, looking down at traffic far below. Some even felt their fear of heights kick in. Another demo showed a cartoon-like robot fight, where users could look all around to follow the action. These examples showed what VR could do beyond gaming.\n\nNate Mitchell, Oculus' vice president, said the company started with games but now thinks VR might also be great for movies. \"We don’t know yet what VR’s biggest use will be,\" he said. It could be games, films, or even military training. Oculus is working with others to create content for all these ideas.\n\nHollywood is also exploring VR. For example, the Sundance Film Festival will show 13 short VR films this month. A company called Jaunt VR has built a special 3D camera that records in all directions. They’ve already made 360-degree concert videos that people can watch on their phones or with VR headsets like Oculus or Google Cardboard.\n\nVR is also being used outside of entertainment. A company called AltspaceVR is creating virtual spaces for meetings. In their app, people appear as cartoon-like avatars. The app tracks head movements and makes the avatars move the same way. It even changes the sound based on how close you are to someone’s avatar, so you can whisper if you're near. AltspaceVR’s CEO, Eric Romo, thinks VR could become a new way to communicate, offering nonverbal cues that phones or video calls can’t.\n\nThough VR meetings might take time to catch on, other uses are closer to reality. Dan Ward, a co-founder of Detroit Labs, believes VR will soon be used for training. For example, the military could use it for combat practice, and emergency workers could train for natural disasters. \"VR can trick the mind really well, and a lot of training is mental,\" Ward said. This could save money compared to building real-life training setups.\n\nAnother company, Sulon Technologies, is using VR for design. Their headset lets users walk around a virtual car engine or change the look of a car without needing a showroom. This could make designing and buying products much easier.\n\nDespite the excitement, there are no high-quality VR headsets for regular buyers yet. Oculus has a developer kit, and Samsung has a limited version of its Gear VR, but big companies like Sony and Oculus say their headsets aren’t ready. Without many users, it’s hard to create content for VR. Mitchell isn’t worried, though. \"It’s still early,\" he said. \"In a few years, VR will be ready for big things.\""

        "gpt": "NEW YORK — More adults in the U.S. are becoming obese, even after years of efforts to help people stay at a healthy weight. New research shows that women now have higher obesity rates than men.  \n\nFor years, experts thought obesity rates had stopped rising. But a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that nearly 38% of adults were obese in 2013-14. This is up from 32% about 10 years earlier.  \n\nDr. William Dietz, an expert on obesity, said this is surprising and shows the problem is getting worse. However, another expert, Barry Popkin, said the study might not reflect the whole country.  \n\nExperts don’t yet know why the obesity rate keeps going up.  \n\nThe report shows that obesity is more common in women than men. For about 10 years, the rates were about the same. But now, 38% of women are obese, compared to 34% of men.  \n\nObesity means being very overweight, not just a little. It is a big health problem in the U.S. In the early 1980s, only about 1 in 6 adults were obese. By about 10 years ago, it was 1 in 3.  \n\nThe report is based on a yearly government survey of about 5,000 people. Unlike other surveys where people might not tell the truth about their weight or height, this one measures participants. That makes it very reliable.  \n\nThis rise in obesity comes despite many efforts to fight it. People are drinking less soda, and fast-food places now offer healthier options. New rules will soon remove unhealthy fats from foods and make restaurants show calorie counts.  \n\nThe study also found differences among groups. Obesity rates are much higher for black and Hispanic women than for men in the same groups. Among black women, 57% are obese, compared to 38% of black men. Among Hispanic women, 46% are obese, compared to 39% of Hispanic men.  \n\nFor children, the obesity rate has stayed about the same at 17% over the past 10 years. Health officials are especially worried about kids. First lady Michelle Obama started the \"Let’s Move\" campaign in 2010 to help children stay healthy.  \n\nThere is some good news for young children. Obesity in kids ages 2 to 5 has dropped. About 8% were obese in 2011-12, down from 14% a decade earlier. The new report shows this drop is real, with the rate staying around 9%.  \n\nThe CDC uses Body Mass Index (BMI) to measure obesity. BMI compares weight to height. For adults, a BMI of 25 to 29.9 means overweight, and 30 or higher means obese. For example, a man who is 5 feet 10 inches tall is overweight at 174 pounds and obese at 209 pounds.  "

        "gpt": "WASHINGTON — Spring is here, and that means it's time for standardized tests in schools across the U.S.\n\nIt’s also when people argue about whether students are taking too many tests.\n\nExperts say testing has increased. Some parents want their kids to skip the tests, and their numbers are growing. Lawmakers are hearing complaints about too much unnecessary testing.\n\nThe Common Core, a set of tougher classroom rules used in over 40 states, has made critics even angrier.\n\nBut new laws might change testing in schools.\n\nThis spring, Congress will discuss changing the No Child Left Behind law. This law, passed in 2002, required yearly tests and punished schools if scores didn’t improve.\n\nA new Senate plan could reduce testing pressure. It would let states, not the federal government, decide how to check if schools are doing well and how to help struggling schools.\n\nThe Senate plan, written by Senators Lamar Alexander (Republican) and Patty Murray (Democrat), says there should be \"fewer and better\" tests.\n\nFor now, most states are using new computer-based tests that focus on critical thinking. But many of the old complaints remain. Parents worry that schools plan lessons just to prepare for tests. Students who don’t test well are at a disadvantage. Critics say too much money is spent on testing, and failing results can lead to school closures, job losses, and harm to students.\n\nSusie Morrison, an education leader in Illinois, said, “We need fewer, better, and fairer tests.” She said parents need to know how their kids are doing, and tests help schools prepare students for college. But not all tests are useful, and some local ones should be removed.\n\nEducation Secretary Arne Duncan agrees that too much testing is a problem. But he still believes schools need yearly tests to hold them accountable for student progress.\n\nUnder No Child Left Behind, schools had to show yearly improvement or face serious consequences, like school takeovers. During the Obama administration, schools could get waivers from the law’s rules, but only if they used test scores to evaluate teachers.\n\nMichael Petrilli, from the Fordham Institute, said some parents have always disliked testing, but complaints have grown because tests are tied to teacher evaluations. He noted that tests for math and reading only affect about 20% of teachers, but many states added tests in other subjects to evaluate all teachers.\n\nParents are also upset about practice tests and benchmarking, which take up a lot of time. Scott Placek, a leader of a Texas parent group, said these extra tests add to the problem.\n\nSome states are reducing tests. For example, North Carolina cut end-of-course tests from 10 to 3 in the past five years. Texas and Virginia also passed laws to reduce state-required tests.\n\nIn Florida, parent groups against testing have grown quickly. Rosemarie Jensen, a leader in the United Opt Out movement, said many parents are now keeping their kids from taking tests. She believes these tests don’t measure a child’s abilities fairly and are more about making money and grading schools.\n\nJensen shared her own family’s experience. Her son struggles with tests, even though he’s a good student, which makes his teachers look bad. Her daughter does well on tests, which can hide poor teaching. She says this system isn’t fair.\n\nDebbie Veney, from the Education Trust, agrees there are too many unnecessary tests. But she believes some tests are essential to see how students are doing and to take action when they aren’t meeting goals.\n\nStu Silberman, a former school superintendent, said schools need to balance accountability and over-testing. He supports informal tests, like quizzes, which help teachers plan lessons. But when tests become too formal and frequent, he said, “it feels like too much.”"

        "gpt": "ANDKHOY, Afghanistan — In 1999, Esmatullah, a 26-year-old day laborer, got engaged through an arranged marriage to a young girl from a nearby village. But 14 years later, he is still not married.\n\nAfghan weddings follow old traditions, including one called *walwar*. This custom makes the groom pay money to the bride's father. The amount can be more than $20,000, which many working-class Afghans cannot afford.\n\nIn Andkhoy, a town of farmers and carpet makers, grooms often borrow money from family and friends, then spend years paying it back. For poor workers like Esmatullah, this is impossible. His fiancée's family demands $13,000. He has borrowed $8,000 but cannot find the rest.\n\n\"I make $6 a day,\" Esmatullah says. \"I don’t know how long it will take to get the rest.\"\n\nWomen’s rights advocates criticize *walwar*. They say it puts a price on daughters and treats women like property. \n\n\"It's like selling a daughter,\" says Mojgan Mostafavi, a deputy minister for women’s affairs in Afghanistan. \"It’s as if they are saying, ‘You are like our livestock.’\"\n\nAlthough *walwar* is technically illegal, it continues because it has been part of Afghan culture for centuries. Fathers and grooms involved in *walwar* payments are rarely punished. It also forces young men into heavy debt, Mostafavi says.\n\nThis is just one problem with Afghan weddings. In a country where most people earn around $35 a month, weddings can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Hundreds of guests are invited, and families spend more on gold jewelry for the bride. For example, Asadullah, a 21-year-old law student, spent $28,000 on his wedding — $13,000 for *walwar*, $12,000 for jewelry, and $3,000 for the party.\n\n\"It’s expensive, but this is how our society works,\" says Asadullah, who comes from a rich family. \"We have no choice but to pay.\"\n\nIn 2011, the government tried to limit weddings to 500 guests. The effort failed because it didn’t get enough support, Mostafavi says.\n\n\"Families spend so much on weddings, but many don’t even have enough food,\" she says. \"I know families that invite 3,000 or 4,000 guests. Boys have to work for years and take loans to pay for weddings. Why is this happening? It’s a big problem for young people.\"\n\nPride is one reason why families spend so much, says Samir Rostiyar, who owns a wedding hall in Kabul. Families want to impress others or avoid being seen as cheap. Weddings also give people a break from the struggles of living in a war-torn country.\n\n\"Afghanistan has been at war for 30 years,\" Rostiyar says. \"People spend this money to forget their troubles, even for one night.\"\n\nAbdullah Rahman, 23, got engaged a year ago. His fiancée’s father wanted $15,000 as *walwar*. After negotiating, they lowered it to $10,000. To raise the money, Rahman left college and started working as a day laborer. So far, he has paid $1,000.\n\n\"My father and I are working to save the money,\" Rahman says. \"I don’t know how long it will take. It’s hard to focus on life when you’re saving for this. It’s our tradition, but I hope someone ends it one day.\""

        "gpt": "LOS ANGELES — In the movie \"Jurassic Park,\" the Tyrannosaurus rex chases and eats anything that moves, crushing bones with its huge jaws and sharp teeth. But scientists don’t all agree with this idea. Some think T. rex might have just eaten dead animals it found instead of hunting.\n\nNow, scientists have found the first clear evidence that T. rex hunted live prey. This discovery shows it was likely at the top of the food chain during the Cretaceous period.\n\nResearchers found part of a T. rex tooth stuck in the backbones of a hadrosaur, a plant-eating dinosaur with a duck-like bill. The hadrosaur’s bones had healed around the tooth, meaning the animal survived the attack. This was reported in the journal *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*.\n\nFor over 100 years, scientists have debated whether T. rex was a hunter or a scavenger. Its skeleton suggests it was built for hunting, with strong legs, sharp teeth, and a huge head. Fossils with T. rex bite marks and partially digested bones near T. rex remains show it ate meat. But these clues don’t prove if the prey was alive or already dead when T. rex ate it.\n\nTo prove T. rex hunted, scientists needed evidence that an animal survived an attack. The tooth and healed bones found in South Dakota’s Hell Creek Formation provide that proof, said David Burnham, a paleontologist from the University of Kansas.\n\nHowever, this doesn’t mean T. rex only hunted. Some fossils show bite marks without signs of healing, which could mean it also ate dead animals. Big meat-eaters today often eat carcasses, and T. rex probably did too. “Why pass up an easy meal?” said Thomas Holtz, a paleontologist from the University of Maryland.\n\nThe hadrosaur bones were discovered in 2007 during a dig to study the ancient environment of Hell Creek. Robert Feeney, an amateur paleontologist, spotted two bones sticking out of the ground. After digging deeper, they found the fused vertebrae with signs of healing. Later, at the University of Kansas, researchers carefully removed the dirt around the bones and found the T. rex tooth crown stuck between them.\n\n“It was a very exciting moment,” Burnham said. The team used a CT scanner to study the tooth and compared its shape and serrations to T. rex teeth. They also identified the hadrosaur’s bones by comparing them to other plant-eating dinosaurs. The bones came from the tail, which matches how modern predators attack—by going for the back legs or tail to stop their prey from escaping.\n\nNot everyone is convinced. Jack Horner, a paleontologist from Montana State University, thinks the T. rex might have bitten the hadrosaur while it was lying down, mistaking it for a dead animal. When it realized the hadrosaur was alive, it may have left. Horner says the study only proves that T. rex bit a live animal, not that it was actively hunting.\n\nBut study leader Robert DePalma disagrees. He says it’s unlikely that a scavenger would start eating something and then stop because it turned out to be alive. Since dinosaurs are extinct, scientists can’t watch them hunt. “We’ll probably never know for sure if T. rex preferred hunting or scavenging,” said Holtz. Still, this fossil gives us an important clue.\n\n“Sometimes it’s the small discoveries that matter,” Holtz added."

        "gpt": "MIAMI — Archaeologists have been digging in downtown Miami and found evidence of a large, ancient Native American village. They believe it is one of the most important prehistoric sites in the United States.\n\nLed by archaeologist Bob Carr, the team has uncovered eight large circles carved into limestone. These circles are thought to be the foundations of homes built by the Tequesta people 2,000 years ago. They also found rows of postholes, which might have been for other structures like boardwalks connecting the homes. The site is near what was once the natural shoreline of Biscayne Bay and the Miami River.\n\n\"This site is unique because it preserves a big part of an ancient Tequesta village,\" Carr said. \"You can see how the buildings and structures were laid out, like an early urban plan in North America.\"\n\nThe discovery has created a problem for the city and a developer, MDM Development Group. The site takes up about half of a two-acre block where MDM plans to build a 34-story hotel, movie theaters, and restaurants. The city approved the project before understanding how important the archaeological site was.\n\nThe site has also revealed thousands of Tequesta artifacts, like tools made of bone and shell, as well as remains of Henry Flagler's 1897 Royal Palm Hotel, which played a key role in Miami's history.\n\nHistoric preservation officials want the city to rethink the project to save at least part of the site. This could mean redesigning the entire project, which would be expensive for the developer. MDM has offered to remove and display some of the limestone circles in a public plaza but has not made any firm promises.\n\n\"There’s no easy solution,\" said Ian Swanson, a director at MDM. While he admitted the site is important, he said there are still questions about exactly what it was. Artifacts from the site are being stored at the HistoryMiami museum for future study.\n\nCarr, who works for MDM as part of the required archaeological survey, has urged the company to preserve as much of the site as possible. \"A necklace is valuable because of all its pearls, not just a few,\" he said.\n\nPreservationists argue that MDM knew the risks when it bought the property, as it is in a protected archaeological zone. Even though the site was covered by a parking lot for 70 years, archaeologists suspected it was part of a Tequesta village because of earlier finds nearby.\n\nThis situation is similar to the battle over the Miami Circle, another Tequesta site Carr discovered in 1998 on the south side of the river. That site was saved after public outcry, and the state bought the land for $27 million. It is now a park, though the circle itself is buried for protection.\n\nThe city's historic preservation board will discuss the new discoveries at a meeting soon. Many preservationists want to save and display at least part of the site. They believe it could become a National Historic Landmark or even a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\nThe site is even more important because Carr's team found evidence of later structures built on top of the Tequesta village. These include a well and artifacts from Fort Dallas, used during the Seminole wars, and parts of Flagler's hotel, which helped start the city of Miami.\n\n\"This is the birthplace of Miami,\" said Gerald Marston, a member of the preservation board.\n\nSome parts of the site, like the Royal Palm Circle, were found years ago, but most discoveries were made in the last six months. Carr admitted he did not notify city and county officials about the finds right away, which he says was a mistake he has now fixed.\n\nThe Tequesta burial ground found under another part of MDM’s project was handled differently. The remains were reburied in a secret location, as required by Florida law."

They warned the water might still smell like licorice, which worried some people.\n\n“I don’t trust it yet,” said Wanda Blake, a Kmart cashier. She thinks she drank the water before hearing about the spill. “I know I got some of it,” she said.\n\nBy Tuesday, about 35% of customers of West Virginia American Water had their water cleared for use. The spill, which happened Thursday, affected 100,000 customers across nine counties, or about 300,000 people in total.\n\nThe water problem caused schools, restaurants, and daycares to close. Trucks brought in water from other states, and people could only use tap water to flush toilets. Hospitals and schools were flushing their systems, and schools hoped to reopen on Wednesday.\n\nIn downtown Charleston, the first area where water was declared safe, life seemed more normal by Monday night. Hotels told guests they could use everything except ice machines. But many businesses in residential neighborhoods stayed closed.\n\nAnthony Majestro, a local lawyer, said many businesses lost money during the shutdown. He is working with several of them and said there have been many lawsuits filed because of the spill.\n\nThe Charleston Fire Department gave out free bottled water. On Monday, cars lined up at a station north of downtown. Firefighters, police, and volunteers handed out about 2,500 cases of water — over 80,000 bottles.\n\nInside the fire station, firefighters were eating frozen dinners. Fire Capt. Eddie Moore said the licorice smell from the taps was very strong Monday morning.\n\nBernard Casdorph, 64, was picking up water twice a day for himself, his mother, her neighbor, and his cousin, who uses a wheelchair. After three days without a shower, he gave in and took one, even though he was worried about the water. “I couldn’t take it anymore,” he said. “I asked everyone if I was turning green or blue.”\n\nOfficials are lifting the water ban slowly to avoid overwhelming the system, which could cause more problems. A map online showed only a small cleared area Monday evening, with most of the nine counties still under the “do not use” warning.\n\nCustomers were given credit for 1,000 gallons of water to flush out their systems. Most people use about 3,300 gallons in a month.\n\nThe crisis began Thursday when a chemical used in coal processing leaked from a tank at a Freedom Industries plant into the Elk River. The chemical, called 4-methylcyclohexane methanol, leaked from a 40,000-gallon tank. Officials believe about 7,500 gallons spilled, though some was contained before reaching the river. It’s unclear how much entered the water supply.\n\nFederal agencies, including the U.S. Chemical Safety Board, are investigating. Tests over the past few days showed the chemical levels were below harmful levels, and some samples showed no trace of the chemical.\n\nSome people put plastic bags over their faucets as a reminder not to use the water. Others left town to take showers or eat at open restaurants.\n\nOnly 14 people went to the hospital for exposure to the contaminated water, and none were seriously ill. Officials said no fish or wildlife were harmed.\n\nThe chemical is not deadly, even in its strongest form. But people were warned not to wash their clothes in the water because it could cause skin irritation, rashes, vomiting, or diarrhea.\n\nGary Southern, the president of Freedom Industries, said Friday night that the leak was stopped. The company has not made further comments."

        "gpt": "CAMP PENDLETON, Calif. — The idea that Marines shouldn’t have families is long gone.\n\nToday, the 43,300 Marines and their families living on this big West Coast base have many comforts. The base feels like a small town with schools, health clinics, a golf course, pools, and lots of child care centers.\n\nThere’s also a new hospital, a movie theater, florists, dry cleaners, big stores, fast-food places, barber shops, and a commissary where groceries cost less than in regular stores. Neighborhoods like Wire Mountain have nice two-story homes with green lawns. Single Marines live in dorms, not old wooden barracks. The base’s website highlights its seaside location and fun activities.\n\n\"We build communities just like outside the base,\" said Robert Marshall, who manages family housing. \"Just because Marines move a lot doesn’t mean their families have to.\"\n\nThis reflects a new way of thinking in the military: take care of families, not just the Marines.\n\nBut some wonder if these big, self-sufficient bases are separating military life from civilian life even more.\n\nAfter the Cold War, the Pentagon shut down many smaller bases to save money. Now, many troops are concentrated on large bases like Fort Bragg in North Carolina or Fort Hood in Texas. These bases are often surrounded by communities filled with military families, veterans, and retirees.\n\nFor example, in San Diego County, the military is the largest employer, providing 133,000 jobs. Around 245,000 veterans live nearby. Last year, the Pentagon added over $25 billion to the local economy.\n\nHowever, some experts worry that these bases make the military feel distant from the rest of the country. Ron Bee, a professor at San Diego State, says most Americans don’t serve in the military or understand its sacrifices. He believes people treat war as something only the military handles and are surprised when global events affect them.\n\nSteve Erie, a professor at UC San Diego, says Americans respect the military but often don’t join it themselves. \"From a civilian view, the all-volunteer military seems to be working fine,\" he said.\n\nAt Camp Pendleton, many believe these improved living conditions helped Marines and their families cope during the long Iraq and Afghanistan wars. The constant deployments and losses were tough, but the community helped.\n\n\"It’s like a family here,\" said Jessica Konczal, whose husband is a Marine. \"If you’re having a hard day, you’ll meet someone who understands.\"\n\nMilitary families often feel civilians don’t understand their challenges, like frequent moves, long separations, or the fear of losing loved ones in combat. \"Civilians just can’t fully get what we go through,\" said Sharon Garcia, waiting for her husband to return from deployment.\n\nCamp Pendleton lost 346 Marines in Iraq, the second-highest number after Fort Hood. Families also deal with suicides and mental health struggles. \"You learn to live with it,\" said Jolene Bopp, whose husband is a Marine.\n\nMany spouses appreciate the base’s safety and amenities. But sometimes, they want a break. \"On base, everything reflects on your husband,\" said Bopp, explaining why she prefers off-base outings.\n\nThe base’s self-sufficiency has changed nearby towns like Oceanside. In the past, deployments hurt local businesses. Now, families mostly shop on base, so the impact is smaller.\n\nStill, officials argue that base life isn’t completely separate from the outside world. Only single Marines live on base full-time, while many married ones live off base. Most Marines leave the military after four years, returning to civilian life.\n\nThe base also opens its doors to civilians for events like mud runs, paintball, and even weddings at its beach facility.\n\nFor people like Chelsey Kurtz, who grew up on base in the 1990s, life has improved. Back then, the base felt like just a workplace. Now, as she lives there with her Marine husband and kids, it feels like a family-friendly community."

        "gpt": "SAN JOSE, Calif. — Strange sea creatures are showing up along the West Coast. Fish like Hawaiian ono are being seen near California, giant sunfish have been spotted in Alaska, and a sea turtle from the Galapagos was found near San Francisco.\n\nThis is happening because the Pacific Ocean near California is much warmer than usual. The water is 5 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal for this time of year, making it one of the warmest autumns in 30 years. \n\nNormally, winds blow from the north and keep warm water near the equator. These winds also stir up cold water from below, a process called upwelling. But this year, the winds have slowed down, so the warm water has moved north, and the cold water isn’t coming up. Scientists don’t know why the winds have stopped or when they’ll return.\n\nThe last time the ocean was this warm was in 1983 and 1997, during strong El Niño years. El Niño is when warm water near the equator changes weather patterns. However, this year’s warming isn’t caused by El Niño or climate change. Scientists say a mild El Niño is on the way, but it’s not the main cause of the current warming.\n\nFor ocean researchers, this warm water has brought a lot of surprises. Eric Sanford, a marine biology professor, said it’s rare to see so many southern species in one year. Scientists near the Farallon Islands have spotted uncommon dolphins, tropical sea snails, and a Guadalupe fur seal, which usually live much farther south. They’ve also seen purple-striped jellyfish, blue barnacles, and a seabird called a Guadalupe murrelet.\n\nIn September, a fisherman near San Francisco caught an endangered green sea turtle, which usually lives near Mexico or the Galapagos Islands. He let it go back into the water. In Southern California, fishermen have found warm-water fish like Hawaiian ono, tripletail, and skipjack tuna. Even Alaska has seen unusual species like giant sunfish.\n\nH.J. Walker, a scientist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, said these animals are following the warm water. Normally, cold water stops them, but now they can swim farther north.\n\nThe warm water has made fishing harder for some species. In many parts of California, salmon catches are low, and squid have been found farther north than usual. Zeke Grader, a fishermen’s group leader, said there’s not much fish near Santa Barbara, just warm, clear water.\n\nBirds have also been affected. Without upwelling, less food like krill is available. On the Farallon Islands, many birds, like common murres, struggled to hatch eggs because their food disappeared. Even whales, which were common near the islands earlier in the year, left when the krill was gone.\n\nScientists expect things to return to normal when the water cools down, as it did after warm years in 1983 and 1997. Joe Welsh from the Monterey Bay Aquarium said this kind of event is unusual but not shocking. \"These things come and go,\" he said. \"There’s still a lot to learn.\""

        "gpt": "NEW YORK — A new idea is turning old payphones into free Wi-Fi spots.\n\nThis week, a tall, slim structure was placed on a Manhattan sidewalk. It is part of a plan to make the largest and fastest Wi-Fi network in the world. The plan will replace payphones with Wi-Fi kiosks.\n\nThe first of at least 7,500 kiosks will start working next year. They will offer free and very fast Wi-Fi, free phone calls, and places to charge your phone. The city will also make money from ads on the kiosks.\n\nMany cities once tried to make public Wi-Fi networks but gave up. Now, some are trying again. New York says this project will give more people access to the internet while updating old payphones.\n\nRight now, the first kiosk is still being tested. It is covered for now, but people are excited about what’s coming.\n\n“It’s great to have free Wi-Fi,” said Jack Thomas, who was texting nearby. “It saves your data plan.”\n\nStill, some are worried about safety when using public Wi-Fi. The city says data will be protected and private.\n\n“I think it makes us easier targets for hackers,” said Bee Mosca, who looked at the kiosk.\n\nPayphones may seem outdated now that most people have smartphones. But New York still has about 8,200 payphones. Some were useful during Superstorm Sandy in 2012, but many are broken or unused.\n\nIn 2012, the city tested Wi-Fi on a few payphones. Then, it created this bigger plan, called \"LinkNYC.\" \n\nA group of companies, including Qualcomm, will pay $200 million to build the kiosks. They will earn money from ads, sharing the profits with the city. The city could make over $500 million in 12 years, much more than the $17 million it makes from payphones now.\n\nEach kiosk will cover about 150 feet with Wi-Fi that is 20 times faster than average home internet. The service is meant for outdoor use, but it might also work inside nearby buildings.\n\nEven though many people already have internet on their phones, this network could save them money on data plans. It could also help tourists who don’t have local phone service.\n\nNot everyone is happy about LinkNYC. A payphone company is suing the city, saying it’s unfair to give one group control of the kiosks. But the city says the deal is legal.\n\nIn the early 2000s, many U.S. cities tried to create public Wi-Fi networks. Most failed because people already had internet at home, and the networks didn’t make enough money. But now, some cities are trying again. For example, Boston is growing its \"Wicked Free WiFi\" network, and Los Angeles is working with companies to offer free Wi-Fi to homes and businesses.\n\nSome people think cities shouldn’t run Wi-Fi systems and should leave it to businesses. But New York is different, says Jeff Kagan, a tech expert."

        "gpt": "WASHINGTON — A federal trademark board decided on Wednesday that the Washington Redskins name is offensive to Native Americans. They ruled that the team’s trademark protections should be canceled. This puts more pressure on the team to change its name.\n\nThe Trademark Trial and Appeal Board made this 2-1 decision after a legal case that has been ongoing for over 20 years. The ruling does not force the team to drop the name, but many people, including politicians, religious leaders, and sports figures, are calling for a change.\n\nThe Redskins said they will appeal the decision. This means the trademark protections will stay in place while the case continues in court, which could take years. \n\nThis is not the first time the board ruled against the team. In 1999, a similar decision was made but was overturned in 2003 because of a technical issue. Redskins lawyer Bob Raskopf said the team is confident they will win again. He added that the ruling does not stop the team from using the name or logo.\n\nThe decision affects six trademarks for the \"Redskins\" name, which were registered between 1967 and 1990. If the ruling is upheld, the team could still use the name, but it would be harder to stop others from selling items with the name without permission.\n\nThe earlier ruling was overturned partly because the people who filed the case waited too long. The case was restarted in 2006 by a younger group of Native Americans who had just become old enough to file a complaint. A hearing for this case was held last year.\n\nCriticism of the team’s name has grown recently. Last weekend, a large group from the United Church of Christ asked its 40,000 members to boycott the Redskins. Half of the U.S. Senate also sent letters to the NFL asking for the name to be changed. D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray said the team would likely need a new name if they want to build a stadium in Washington, D.C.\n\nTeam owner Dan Snyder has repeatedly said he will never change the name. He refused to comment on the ruling after a practice session on Wednesday. Redskins players have mostly stayed quiet on the issue. Quarterback Robert Griffin III said players are focusing on football and letting legal experts handle the issue.\n\nTo respond to critics, the Redskins started the Original Americans Foundation to help Native American tribes. However, Suzan Shown Harjo, a leader in the trademark case, called the foundation \"a mix of PR and bribery.\"\n\nMany people who want the name changed welcomed the board’s decision. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said, \"Daniel Snyder may be the last person to see this, but it’s only a matter of time before he has to do the right thing.\""

        "gpt": "HARTFORD, Conn. — When Porter the dog tries to figure out why his owner hides a toy bone under a bucket, his reaction might help scientists learn more about how humans grow and develop, including autism and learning disabilities.\n\nThis is the goal of Laurie Santos, who leads the Canine Cognition Center at Yale University. The center, which opened in December, studies how dogs think and learn. Santos explained that Porter, a 4-year-old chocolate Lab mix, is raised in a similar environment to human kids. Comparing how he learns with how children learn can teach us more about human development.\n\n\"Dogs are much more tuned in to what humans care about compared to other animals, like chimpanzees,\" Santos said. \"In some ways, they act more like human children than other species.\"\n\nEven though humans expect a lot from dogs — like loyalty, companionship, and fetching slippers — we rarely think about what drives their behavior. That’s starting to change in the academic world, where scientists are becoming more interested in studying dogs.\n\nThe Canine Cognition Center is an example of this growing interest. Santos and her team study how dogs make decisions and understand social cues. Santos, a professor of psychology, is also well-known for her research on monkeys. However, she said dogs offer something monkeys cannot.\n\n\"Monkeys are great for studying evolution since they’re closely related to us, but they grow up in very different environments from humans,\" Santos said. \"Dogs, on the other hand, live in the same spaces as us and face similar challenges.\"\n\nDogs don’t speak or think like humans, but they grow up in human environments and rely on similar signals to understand the world. Santos and her team want to know: What can dogs' thinking tell us about our own minds?\n\nStudying dogs is also easier than studying monkeys. Monkeys need special housing, but dogs can live at home with their owners. At the center, owners bring their dogs for short studies, usually lasting 30 to 45 minutes, and then take them back home. These studies include simple games to test problem-solving skills. Owners can even watch their dogs during the tests.\n\nSo far, about 300 dogs are registered with the center, and 40 are actively participating in studies. Dogs must be spayed or neutered, vaccinated, healthy, and have no history of aggression. Accepted dogs even get a fancy admission letter, just like Yale students.\n\n## A Look at Dog Science\n\nThe study of dog behavior isn’t new. In the early 1900s, Ivan Pavlov famously studied dogs' responses to food. Studies of dog behavior peaked in the 1960s but slowed down until picking up again in the 2000s. \n\nErica Feuerbacher, a researcher at the University of Florida, said earlier studies used dogs to learn about humans. But now, scientists are curious about how dogs' minds work on their own. \"Today, we see dogs and cats as part of our families and recognize how adaptable they are,\" she said.\n\nBrian Hare, an expert in evolutionary anthropology at Duke University, said dogs have developed emotional intelligence because of domestication. \"Dogs aren’t just smart in the way we usually think,\" Hare said. \"They’re emotionally smart. They bond with humans and see us as partners.\"\n\nHare added that studying dogs is useful because they play many important roles in society, like guiding the blind, detecting bombs, or even finding cancer. Learning more about dogs helps us pick the best ones for these jobs.\n\nHare’s interest in dog intelligence started when he noticed his own dog could solve a problem that stumped monkeys: finding hidden food under a bucket. This led him to explore other ways dogs’ abilities had been underestimated.\n\nNot everyone has always supported studying dogs. About 20 years ago, researcher Alice Moon-Fanelli studied obsessive behaviors in dogs, similar to OCD in humans. At the time, people doubted the idea, but now it’s widely accepted. However, Moon-Fanelli said many owners assume their dogs have OCD when they actually just want a toy or treat.\n\nOne of Santos’ big questions is whether dogs have something called \"theory of mind.\" This is the ability to understand that other people think differently than you do. Human children develop this skill around age 3, but kids with autism often struggle with it. Studying how dogs understand what others are thinking could help scientists learn more about autism in humans.\n\nSantos said dogs have a lot to teach us. For centuries, dogs have depended on humans for food and care. Because of this, they’ve become very good at understanding human emotions and behavior."

        "gpt": "WASHINGTON — Greg Page, the CEO of Cargill Inc., gave a speech to the World Cocoa Foundation but didn’t mention \"child labor.\" Instead, he focused on \"sustainability.\" For companies like Cargill, sustainability means stopping child labor on cocoa farms while making sure cocoa production stays profitable.\n\nFor over 10 years, reports have shown kids being forced to leave school or even being taken and made to work without pay on cocoa farms. Studies by Tulane University show companies have tried to fix this, but many children still work on farms, often in unsafe conditions.\n\nCargill believes the solution is to make cocoa farming more productive and profitable. This way, farmers and governments might stop using child labor and send kids to school instead. Cargill has a plan called the \"Cocoa Promise,\" which focuses on protecting children’s rights and making cocoa farming sustainable. Greg Page explained sustainability as meeting today’s needs without hurting the future.\n\nSenator Tom Harkin of Iowa helped create a 2001 agreement called the Harkin-Engel Protocol to combat child labor in the cocoa industry. He says companies like Cargill, Mars, Nestlé, and Hershey have made progress, but it’s been slow. The cocoa industry committed $10 million in 2010 to fight child labor in Ivory Coast and Ghana, the two largest cocoa producers. While this money helped, Harkin says more is needed.\n\nCargill has spent $5 million in the past three years in these countries to reduce child labor. The company works with CARE International to support communities and plans to extend this program for another three years. However, progress is slow because Cargill focuses on helping communities take control of their future. The first step is to reduce poverty by improving cocoa farming.\n\nAbout 70% of the world’s cocoa comes from West Africa, mostly from small farms. Around 1.8 million children work on cocoa farms in Ivory Coast and Ghana. Companies like Cargill buy cocoa from these farmers, process it, and sell it to chocolate makers or use it themselves.\n\nThe issue of child labor in cocoa farming became widely known around 2000 after reports of child trafficking and unsafe working conditions. Some children are brought from nearby countries like Burkina Faso and Mali to work on farms. They may do dangerous jobs like using pesticides or machetes. These activities can harm their health and interfere with their education.\n\nThe Harkin-Engel Protocol was created to stop the worst forms of child labor. While it has led to some action, like helping nearly 650,000 people in 290 communities, it hasn’t fully reached its goals. For example, the cocoa industry hasn’t developed a way to certify that cocoa is free from child labor. The original goal of ending the worst forms of child labor by 2005 wasn’t met, and the new target is a 70% reduction by 2020. Progress so far raises doubts about meeting this goal.\n\nThe U.S. Labor Department has funded Tulane University to monitor child labor in Ivory Coast and Ghana. In 2013-2014, Tulane received $1.5 million to study the problem further. Meanwhile, Cargill continues its \"Cocoa Promise\" program, focusing on teaching farmers better farming methods and training staff to recognize child labor. If child labor is found, Cargill prefers to have open discussions to solve the problem rather than punishing communities.\n\nCargill says working with local leaders is key. Cooperation from governments in Ivory Coast and Ghana is growing. \"We operate in their country, but it’s still their country,\" said Cargill’s manager Taco Terheijden. \"We have to work together to succeed.\""

Her first words to the cheering crowd were, \"Thank you.\" About 4,000 people, young and old, had come to hear 17-year-old Malala Yousafzai speak. Girls in the audience held copies of her book, *I Am Malala.* Parents whispered her story to their children.\n\nAfghan-American author Khaled Hosseini introduced her by saying, \"The gunman shot the girl he aimed for, but in every other way, he shot the wrong girl.\"\n\nDuring the hour-long talk with Hosseini, Malala showed she was both smart and funny. She said, \"There’s always been this fear that if you educate girls, they’ll get out of control. But everyone has the right to education and to discover more in life.\" She joked about her family, saying, \"My brothers think they are treated unfairly, but I think that’s okay.\"\n\nWhen Malala was just 11, she started speaking out against unfair rules in her home region of Swat Valley in Pakistan, which was controlled by the Taliban. She became known as the writer of a BBC blog about life under the Taliban, using the fake name \"Gul Makai.\" The blog talked about how girls were banned from going to school.\n\nOn October 9, 2012, when she was 15, the Taliban tried to silence her forever. A gunman shot her three times. The attack shocked the world. Malala was flown to a hospital in Pakistan and then to England for surgery. She survived and has since continued her fight for girls’ education through her nonprofit, the Malala Fund. She also became a co-winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, sharing it with Kailash Satyarthi, an activist for children’s rights in India.\n\nOn Friday, Malala spoke to the Silicon Valley audience about life in Pakistan. She described how girls and boys were treated differently, even at the dinner table. \"Boys would get the best parts of the chicken, like the chest and legs. Girls would get the wings and neck,\" she said.\n\nMalala’s passion for education came from her father, Ziauddin Yousafzai. He ran a group of private schools and made sure education was available to all children. He even allowed 150 poor students to attend for free, even though some parents complained because they didn’t want their kids mixing with poorer children. \"He’s always been an inspiring father,\" Malala said, asking him to stand up from his seat. But she admitted they sometimes argue. \"We had a fight in the car,\" she joked.\n\nMalala and Hosseini also talked about the power of words. Hosseini, who wrote the popular book *The Kite Runner,* said, \"The first word revealed to the prophet in Islam was ‘read.’ I find it strange that this word is now used to stop women and girls from learning.\"\n\nHosseini asked Malala why she chose to speak out. Malala explained, \"If you stay silent, you keep living in fear. If you speak up, it’s hard too, but at least you’re trying to make a change.\"\n\nMalala is now traveling around the U.S. with her father. Her nonprofit, the Malala Fund, is working to make sure all children get 12 years of free education by 2030. On Tuesday, she visited Congress for the first time and met with lawmakers like Senator John McCain and Representatives Kay Granger and Nita Lowey. She talked about how important U.S. support is for global education programs. Malala also praised First Lady Michelle Obama’s \"Let Girls Learn\" campaign."

        "gpt": "KABUL, Afghanistan — Kabul is a city caught in war, and it has become one of the world's most unattractive cities.\n\nOnce, the city had wide streets with rose gardens. Now, the streets are crowded with cars and lined with tall concrete walls. These walls protect people inside from bombs and bullets caused by a 14-year conflict. After recent attacks, more walls were added quickly. They now surround government buildings, businesses, embassies, and the homes of powerful people.\n\nThese walls create a feeling of separation. Inside, the rich and powerful are safe. Outside, people must look out for themselves.\n\nKabir Mokamel, an artist who moved back to Kabul from Australia four years ago, sees these walls as a chance to change how the city looks and how its people think. His group, Art Lords, uses street art to talk about Afghanistan’s problems after nearly 40 years of war. The name Art Lords is a joke about the warlords who still control Afghan politics and are seen as heroes.\n\n\"I want people to see who the real heroes are,\" said Mokamel, 46. \"In Afghanistan's history, heroes are always fighters with swords and guns. But I want people to think about others, like the workers who clean our streets and try to make life better. This can help us move away from always thinking about war.\"\n\nRecently, his group painted pictures of street cleaners in orange jackets on a wall near the secret service building. Next to the pictures, big black letters read: \"The Heroes of My City: The Street Sweepers.\"\n\nAhmad Jan, a 26-year-old worker, stopped to look at the art. \"It’s interesting,\" he said. \"People will see it, read the message, and think differently.\"\n\nVolunteer Maryam Kohi helps paint every day. \"These walls block roads and make the city feel like a prison,\" she said. \"Afghanistan has been fighting for so long, and the city is full of dirt and corruption. Through these paintings, we want to tell people to stand against corruption.\"\n\nThis week, President Ashraf Ghani called corruption a \"cancer\" that threatens the country. He said it’s shameful that Afghanistan is often named one of the most corrupt countries in the world. The government has a plan to fight this with reforms and stricter rules.\n\n\"Corruption isn’t just about bribery,\" Mokamel said. \"It’s also about bad habits like not waiting your turn, driving dangerously, or harassing women.\"\n\nKabul was built for 450,000 people, but now 4.5 million live there. The city’s transport, water, and sewage systems haven’t kept up. Mokamel remembers Kabul as a friendly place before the war. \"People were kind and trusting,\" he said. \"But war has changed everything.\"\n\nThat memory inspired him to come back to Kabul in 2010 after fleeing as a teenager. In Australia, he was a graphic artist and studied for a Master’s degree in Fine Arts. \"I learned a lot abroad and wanted to bring it back,\" he said.\n\nThe Art Lords’ work includes a series called \"Healing the Wounds of Afghanistan.\" It features red hearts painted on walls. One heart is a balloon held by a girl, and another is in a handcart. In one painting, a red map of Afghanistan is covered with a Band-Aid. Their next project will focus on suicide bombings, which have killed over 50 people in Kabul recently. Mokamel carries an official letter to show to police, who sometimes think he is vandalizing.\n\nThe group’s first painting appeared in July at the National Directorate of Security. It showed a pair of beautiful eyes on the walls, sending a message to corrupt officials. Local people loved it and understood its meaning right away. Corruption and unemployment are two of the biggest problems in Afghanistan.\n\nArt is slowly coming back to Afghanistan, but most people, who are very poor, don’t have access to it. Many fans of the Art Lords’ work visit every day to help paint. \"I tell them it’s important,\" Mokamel said. \"When you paint even a small part of a wall, that part of the wall disappears.\""

Recently, Disney tested phone ordering at the Backlot Express restaurant and during the Fantasmic! night show.\n\nSeaWorld Orlando started letting guests use an app to order food at Seaport Pizza last November. This summer, SeaWorld plans to expand the app to more restaurants and parks.\n\n\"It's very convenient, and guests love it,\" said Cathy Valeriano, a SeaWorld manager. \"This is the future.\"\n\nHowever, theme parks are still behind compared to regular restaurants. Chains like Panera Bread and Olive Garden already offer online ordering. Publix grocery stores started letting people order deli sandwiches online back in 2013.\n\nTheme parks and restaurants say they are doing this because people like using technology and want things to be easier.\n\nUsing apps also means fewer cashiers are needed, said Chris Muller, a professor at Boston University.\n\nShortening ride lines is a big problem for theme parks. Food lines are less important, said Robert Niles, who runs the blog Theme Park Insider.\n\n\"In restaurants, the main focus is food. At theme parks, food comes second to rides,\" Niles said. \"Parks have mostly focused on skipping lines for rides and shows.\"\n\nNiles also said parks need to be careful about adding too many line-skipping options. Too many choices might confuse visitors.\n\nDisney wouldn’t do an interview but said in an email that it is working to meet guests' changing needs. Disney’s MyMagic+ technology helps guests plan ahead and use digital tools more easily.\n\nUniversal Orlando didn’t respond to questions.\n\nIn February, Disney’s Be Our Guest restaurant began letting guests make lunch reservations and preorder meals up to 30 days in advance. Guests pay when they arrive. Reservations need a credit card guarantee.\n\nThe restaurant also has touchscreens for ordering lunch.\n\nDisney is also trying other digital ideas, like personalized menus and employees with tablets taking orders from people waiting in line.\n\nBut changing how people behave in theme parks can be hard, Niles said.\n\n\"People are on vacation and don’t want to think too much,\" he explained. He said tools like MyMagic+ help because guests can plan at home instead of making decisions at the park.\n\nAt SeaWorld, during a recent lunch hour, no one was picking up food from Seaport Pizza’s preorder window. SeaWorld didn’t say how many people use the app but said it’s more popular during busy vacation times.\n\nRight now, the app only offers family-sized pizzas for $29.99, not single slices. SeaWorld plans to add more menu choices this summer.\n\nSeaWorld is also adding self-service kiosks. At the new Manta Soft Serve ice-cream stand, guests can order and pay with credit or debit cards at a kiosk.\n\nStill, many people chose to stand in the cash-only line with a cashier. British visitors Toni Crews and Simon Wilkin tried the kiosk and liked it.\n\nTheir only problem? \"We had to take off our sunglasses because of the glare,\" Wilkin said.\n\n\"It was really easy,\" Crews added. \"It’s a good idea. There was no line.\""

        "gpt": "ALLENTOWN, Pa. — When someone mentions Gettysburg, Jeff Stocker shifts in his chair.\n\nStocker, wearing a tie with Abraham Lincoln’s face on it, tilts his head back and smiles. “Gettysburg looks different,” he says. “It even smells different.”\n\n“To be in the field at Gettysburg … it gives me chills just talking about it,” he says from his law office in Allentown, Pennsylvania.\n\nGettysburg, about 10 miles north of the Mason-Dixon line, is where Stocker’s great-grandfather saved a wounded Union captain by pulling him away from approaching Confederate soldiers. It’s also where Stocker used to visit with his father, retracing the footsteps of soldiers from the Civil War. On Monday, Stocker returned to Gettysburg to mark the 150th anniversary of the battle.\n\nGettysburg is also the inspiration for Stocker’s latest book, *We Fought Desperate.* The book tells the story of the 153rd Pennsylvania Volunteer Regiment, a group of young, inexperienced soldiers from eastern Pennsylvania, including Stocker’s great-grandfather.\n\nFor seven years, Stocker has studied Gettysburg through letters, diaries, and other records of soldiers who fought there. “The dots on the map are people,” Stocker says. “These were real people with real families, just like you.”\n\nOne of those soldiers was Heinrich Feirich, a 40-year-old shoemaker from Prussia. Feirich joined the 153rd in 1862, even though his wife was pregnant at the time. After a few months, Feirich became deaf and was reassigned to help Capt. George Young with chores like washing clothes.\n\nIn June 1863, Confederate forces led by Gen. Robert E. Lee invaded the North. On July 1, the 153rd marched to Gettysburg and took a position on a hill. But they were too far from the rest of their corps, and Confederate soldiers attacked them hard. Capt. Young was shot in the face, one of more than 250 soldiers in the regiment who were killed, wounded, or captured.\n\nFeirich tried to drag Young to safety, but Young told him to save himself. Young was captured but survived the war. Feirich finished his nine-month enlistment and later joined another regiment. He was injured in the knee, which caused him pain for the rest of his life. After the war, he became a U.S. citizen and lived until 1894.\n\nFeirich’s family grew after the war. One of his daughters, Emma, married Albert Stocker. Their youngest son, Donald Stocker, was born in 1919. Donald fought in World War II and later took his own son, Jeff, to Gettysburg. As they walked the battlefield, Donald would talk about Feirich and wonder what he looked like.\n\nJeff grew up loving history, especially firsthand accounts like letters and diaries. Over time, he collected about 1,000 Civil War manuscripts and donated copies to Gettysburg’s library.\n\nIn 1990, a Gettysburg historian suggested that Jeff publish one of the manuscripts. He did, and it became his first book. Later, Jeff co-wrote another book about Civil War regiments. By 2006, when that book was published, Donald was in his mid-80s and still visiting Gettysburg.\n\nJeff wanted to write about Feirich and the 153rd regiment for his father. He started researching every soldier in the regiment — all 993 of them. He read diaries, letters, and newspapers, and visited libraries and archives. His office is now filled with stacks of papers, which his wife doesn’t want at home.\n\nThe title of his book, *We Fought Desperate,* comes from a soldier’s description of another battle the 153rd fought before Gettysburg.\n\nThis week, thousands of people are visiting Gettysburg for the anniversary. Jeff knows his father would have been there too, walking the battlefield. Donald passed away last summer at age 93. Jeff placed a manuscript of *We Fought Desperate* in his father’s coffin."

        "gpt": "WASHINGTON — Yosemite National Park needs a lot of repairs, said National Park Service Director Jonathan B. Jarvis on Tuesday.  \n\nThe work needed isn’t fancy and isn’t just for Yosemite. Across all national parks, there is a $11.5 billion backlog of repairs. This is a big problem as the National Park Service asks for money from companies and Congress to celebrate its 100th anniversary in 2016.  \n\n“No one wants to pay to fix the wastewater system at Yosemite,” Jarvis told a House subcommittee. “That’s the government’s job.”  \n\nFiguring out how to pay for it has caused disagreements between Democrats and Republicans.  \n\nThe Obama administration’s $3 billion budget for the National Park Service includes hundreds of millions for repair projects.  \n\nAt Yosemite, the repair list includes fixing sewer lines at El Portal, replacing septic systems at Crane Flat Campground, and improving the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias.  \n\nOther parks also have problems. Sequoia National Park needs a new water treatment plant for Lodgepole Campground. Lassen Volcanic National Park needs a new utility system at its headquarters.  \n\nTo help with these repairs, the administration’s budget includes a plan to spend $300 million a year for three years, along with other funds for repairs.  \n\n“This is a big request in today’s tight budget,” Jarvis said. “The repair needs are huge.”  \n\nRepresentative Tom McClintock, a Republican from California and chairman of the House Subcommittee on Federal Lands, asked Jarvis to choose between fixing parks or buying new land. Jarvis said repairs should come first.  \n\nThis suggests that the Republican-controlled Congress will likely change the budget proposal. They may give less money and focus on different priorities.  \n\n“Shouldn’t we fix the parks we already have before buying more land?” McClintock asked.  \n\nRepresentative Doug LaMalfa, another Republican from California, agreed. He said he was worried about the park service asking for money to buy land while repairs are still needed.  \n\nThe park service wants to buy land for parks in Colorado and Hawaii, among other places. The Bureau of Land Management also wants to buy land for areas like the Carrizo Plains National Monument in California.  \n\nA memo from Republican staff called the park service’s budget request “out of control spending.”  \n\nTuesday’s hearing was the first since McClintock became chairman. It gave him and other Republicans a chance to share their ideas.  \n\nMcClintock, whose district includes Yosemite, pushed for more public use of parks. He mentioned activities like biking, horseback riding, and ice skating.  \n\n“At Yosemite, there’s been an effort to reduce or remove these activities,” McClintock said. “That sends the wrong message to the public.”  "

        "gpt": "Scientists are gathering more and more evidence that we are living in a new geologic epoch, called the Anthropocene. Geologists who study Earth's layers of rock, known as strata, are debating this idea. One of these geologists, Jan Zalasiewicz from Leicester University, says the signs of this new epoch are clear and happening fast. He and his team have published evidence in the journal *Science* showing that humans are leaving a big, lasting mark on Earth.\n\nThe current epoch, called the Holocene, began 11,700 years ago when the last ice age ended. Back then, Earth's carbon dioxide (CO2) levels rose very slowly—about one part per million (ppm) every hundred years. But now, CO2 levels are rising by two ppm every year. This is mostly because humans burn fossil fuels and change the land. Instead of cooling down, the planet is heating up, melting more ice and changing the environment.\n\nSince about 1950, humans have had an even bigger impact on Earth. This time period is sometimes called the \"Great Acceleration.\" During this time, people have created long-lasting materials like plastics and concrete. Enough concrete has been made to cover every square meter of the planet with one kilogram. Each year, people produce as much plastic as the combined weight of all humans on Earth. Mining moves three times more rock and dirt than all the rivers on Earth combined. Even tiny particles from burning fuels, like coal and oil, can now be found in faraway places like tropical lakes and the Pacific Ocean. These changes are leaving permanent marks on Earth's rocks and layers.\n\nSome scientists believe these changes are so big that they mark the beginning of a new epoch, different from the Holocene. Humans have also changed the course of evolution by moving plants and animals around the world or driving some species to extinction. These changes are similar to the biological markers geologists use to define other time periods in Earth's history.\n\nHowever, scientists still debate when the Anthropocene began. Some think it started thousands of years ago, when humans began farming or burning forests. Others suggest it began more recently, around 1950, when human population and activities like nuclear bomb testing increased. For example, the first atomic bomb test in 1945 left radioactive elements in Earth's layers that will last for at least 100,000 years.\n\nStudying these changes in Earth's layers is still a work in progress. Scientists need to examine places like the ocean floor off California to look for signs of the Anthropocene, such as radioactive elements or tiny soot particles. This work requires time, money, and detailed research.\n\nEven within the group studying the Anthropocene, not everyone agrees on whether to officially recognize it or when it began. Some argue that it is too short to be a proper epoch. Others think the biggest changes, like mass extinctions, haven't happened yet. Some suggest learning from archaeologists to better understand how humans have shaped Earth for thousands of years.\n\nAt the heart of the debate is the question of how human history and Earth's geologic history fit together. If the Anthropocene marks a time when humans caused major changes to the planet, it might make sense to officially recognize it. But some scientists wonder if it is useful for geology. For now, the study of the Anthropocene is still new, and researchers are working to gather more evidence and ideas before making a formal decision."

        "gpt": "It was a hot August morning, the kind of day when you dream of eating ice to cool down. Ice was on Aja Evans’ mind too, but for another reason. She wanted to get back to the ice of bobsledding, a sport where she had already made her mark in her first season.\n\nAja was on her way to a gym in Highland Park, Illinois, to train for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. At the gym, she was greeted by her trainer, Jacob Ross, a reporter, a photographer, and a surprise visitor from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. The agency’s officer had come to collect a urine sample, something only top athletes are required to do.\n\nAfter that, Aja began her workout. She wore a purple top, black tights, and turquoise sneakers with purple laces. Her exercises were intense. She did squats with 365 pounds, deadlifts with 195 pounds, flipped a 400-pound tire, and jumped onto a stack of pads over 4 feet high. Her trainer said the goal was to make her as strong and powerful as possible for bobsledding.\n\nAja has always been an incredible athlete. She was a Big Ten champion in the shot put and a fast sprinter in high school. Her athleticism amazed others at the gym, including professional football players. Even her brother, Fred, who plays for the Minnesota Vikings, and NFL star Matt Forte, were impressed by her skills.\n\nAja comes from a family of talented athletes. Her father, Fred, was a champion swimmer. Her uncle and cousin both played Major League Baseball. But no one in her family had tried bobsledding before.\n\n### Discovering Bobsledding\n\nAja first thought about bobsledding after her college track coach noticed her skills matched what bobsledders need. At first, she considered becoming a professional track athlete, but when she learned about bobsled combines (tests for new athletes), she decided to try it. In 2012, she scored the highest at the combine and surprised everyone by winning the dry-land push trials.\n\nSoon, Aja was training on ice. Her first bobsled ride was scary and unfamiliar. She didn’t know if she could handle it, but her mom encouraged her to stick with it. On her second run, she told herself, “It’s worth it.” By the end of her first season, she had won medals and set records on several tracks.\n\nAja is now competing for a spot on the U.S. Olympic bobsled team alongside other top athletes, including Lolo Jones and Lauryn Williams. Her driver, Elana Meyers, says Aja is perfect for bobsledding because of her strength and power. Together, they make a great team.\n\n### The Push and the Race\n\nIn a bobsled race, the push phase is critical. Aja and the driver push the sled for about 20-30 meters before jumping in. Once inside, Aja stays still to avoid disrupting the sled’s movement. She has never crashed during a race, but she knows how challenging the sport can be.\n\nBobsledders also handle their own sleds, moving and preparing them before and after races. Winning medals is especially rewarding because it means they get a break from moving the heavy sleds.\n\nAja’s silver medal in Sochi was particularly meaningful. Her grandfather, who had always supported her, passed away just days before the race. Her mom encouraged her to stay and compete, saying her grandfather would have wanted her to. Aja pushed through her emotions and performed well, which made her even more determined for the next season.\n\nNow, Aja is ready for what’s ahead. She has overcome challenges and feels like she’s on a victory lap. As she trains and dreams of success on the ice, she’s ready to show the world what she can do."

        "gpt": "ATHENS, Ga. — A few years ago, Georgia high schools were asked to make rules about sports in hot weather. One school said they would cut back practices if the heat index reached 140. But experts laughed because a heat index of 140 is like being in a desert. Bud Cooper, a sports medicine expert at the University of Georgia, said, \"That’s way too hot for anyone to practice.\"\n\nThis policy showed an old way of thinking: \"no pain, no gain.\" Some believed athletes had to push themselves to the limit to get better. But now, many schools and states are changing their focus. They are putting safety first and making rules to protect student athletes from serious injuries or illnesses.\n\nSince 2009, all states have made laws to protect high school athletes from concussions. These laws make sure players are taken out of games if they might have a concussion. They also explain when it’s safe for them to play again. Some states now require schools to have defibrillators to help with sudden heart problems. Others have rules to prevent heat-related illnesses or injuries from doing the same motion over and over, like pitching in baseball.\n\nHowever, experts say the best way to keep athletes safe is to hire full-time athletic trainers. Only 39% of public high schools in the U.S. have full-time trainers, according to the Korey Stringer Institute. Many schools have nurses, but they leave after school ends, just as practices and games start.\n\nDoug Casa, an expert on heat illnesses, says, \"The most important thing is to have an athletic trainer on staff.\" The Korey Stringer Institute is named after a football player who died from heat stroke in 2001. His death raised awareness about heat safety, but it took years for high schools to act.\n\nIn Georgia, heat-related football deaths were a big problem. Between 1980 and 2009, six players died. In 2011, two more players died, including 16-year-old Don'Terio Searcy. Practices were starting earlier in the summer, during the hottest months. At the time, each school made its own rules about heat, but this wasn’t working.\n\nRalph Sweargin, the head of the Georgia High School Association (GHSA), decided to create statewide rules. He asked researchers, including Bud Cooper, to study the effects of heat on players. They found that players, especially linemen, were at risk during the first few days of practice. Players needed time to get used to the heat.\n\nThe researchers also said the heat index wasn’t enough to measure safety. They recommended using a tool called the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) calculator. This tool measures air temperature, humidity, and heat from the ground, like on a football field. The GHSA made new rules in 2012. Schools must use the WBGT calculator, and coaches must follow safety steps when it gets too hot. For example, if it’s very hot, practices must be shorter, players can wear lighter gear, and outdoor practices may be canceled.\n\nSadly, these rules came too late for Don'Terio Searcy. In 2011, he collapsed during a practice in Florida. Coaches made him practice again the next day, even though he said he felt sick. He collapsed again and died later that day. His family believes he would still be alive if the coaches had taken better precautions. They are trying to hold the school district and camp responsible.\n\nHeat isn’t the only danger in sports. Concussions and sudden heart problems are also serious risks. Some states require schools to have defibrillators, but many don’t bring them to the fields. Overuse injuries are another problem. Playing one sport all year can harm muscles and joints. For example, baseball pitchers often hurt their elbows or shoulders, and soccer players can injure their knees.\n\nDr. Jeffrey Dugas, a surgeon, says overuse injuries have increased a lot. He believes parents and coaches push kids too hard. Mark Hyman, a sports journalist, agrees. He says, \"In the past, if kids felt pain, they stopped playing. Now, adults push them to keep going.\"\n\nExperts say adults need to set limits to protect young athletes. Safety should always come first."

        "gpt": "WASHINGTON — A new survey shows that young African-Americans are just as active in getting news online as young white people. This challenges the old idea that people of color might fall behind in using technology.\n\nThe poll found that 64% of all young adults, aged 18-34, regularly read or watch news online. For African-Americans, the number is 66%, while 65% of white millennials and 53% of Hispanic millennials do the same.\n\nThe results show that even though young people may not use traditional news sources like newspapers, they are still getting news, especially through social media.\n\nFor example, 57% of millennials say they get news from Facebook every day, and 81% use Facebook for news at least once a week. The survey also found that African-Americans and Hispanics are just as likely as others to pay for news subscriptions.\n\n\"People of color are very skilled with technology,\" said Tom Rosenstiel, leader of the American Press Institute, which helped with the study. He added that young people often find news about specific topics through social media and community sharing, instead of traditional ways.\n\nIn the 1990s, some worried that minorities might not have equal access to technology, a problem called the \"digital divide.\" But over time, minorities became some of the biggest users of new technology, like smartphones.\n\nThe study found no sign that African-Americans or Hispanics are behind in using technology. Nearly all young adults, no matter their background, use smartphones, and about half use tablets.\n\nThere were also no big differences between racial groups in how they use Facebook for news. However, about half of African-American millennials said they comment on news stories on Facebook, compared to about 3 in 10 white and Hispanic millennials.\n\nAfrican-American millennials are also more likely to use Facebook to follow trending topics. About 41% of African-Americans do this, compared to 29% of whites and 24% of Hispanics.\n\nHispanics and African-Americans are more likely than white millennials to get news from YouTube or Instagram. For example, 38% of Hispanics and 33% of African-Americans use YouTube for news, compared to just 20% of whites. On Instagram, 45% of African-Americans and 30% of Hispanics get news, compared to 19% of whites.\n\nRosenstiel said YouTube is popular because anyone can create content without needing approval from big companies. Topics that aren't covered in mainstream media often find large audiences on YouTube, including gaming, comedy, and news commentary.\n\nWhen asked about their favorite online activities, African-Americans said they stream music, TV, or movies the most. Hispanics said they like keeping up with friends, while white millennials said they check and send emails the most.\n\nRosenstiel noted that young people have more in common online than many expected. \"We've created new ways to connect,\" he said.\n\nThe survey included 1,045 young adults, with 163 African-Americans and 162 Hispanics. It was done between January 5 and February 2, 2015, by the Media Insight Project. The results have a margin of error of 3.8 percentage points, and the error is higher for smaller groups."

        "gpt": "WASHINGTON — New research shows it might be possible to predict which preschoolers will have trouble learning to read. It has to do with how their brains understand speech when there’s background noise.\n\nScientists want to figure out, as early as they can, which children might struggle with learning. This way, kids can get help early. There are already simple reading tests for preschoolers. But researchers at Northwestern University took it further. They studied brain waves in children as young as 3 years old.\n\nThe research found that how well a child’s brain picks out certain sounds — like consonants — in noisy surroundings can show who might struggle with reading later on. The team shared their findings on July 14 in the journal *PLOS Biology*.\n\nIf this method works, it could give scientists a way to see early signs of reading problems, said Nina Kraus, the lead researcher and director of Northwestern’s Auditory Neuroscience Lab. \"If you know a 3-year-old is at risk, you can start helping them right away by giving them more experiences with sound during those important early years,\" Kraus said.\n\nLearning to connect sounds to meaning is a big step toward learning to read. For example, kids who can match sounds to letters earlier usually learn to read more easily.\n\nPart of this learning involves how the brain processes sounds. If a brain is slower to tell the difference between a \"D\" sound and a \"B\" sound, it could make recognizing words and forming sentences harder.\n\nWhy does noise matter? Noise makes it harder for the brain to focus on specific sounds. The brain has to work fast, in just tiny fractions of a second, to block out other sounds and focus on the important one. Consonants are especially tricky in noisy environments because they’re quieter and shorter than vowels, Kraus explained.\n\n\"Hearing in noisy places is one of the hardest things we ask our brain to do,\" she said.\n\nIn the study, researchers used a test called an EEG to measure how the brain reacts to sounds. They placed small sensors on the children’s heads to record brain activity. The kids watched a video while wearing earphones. In one ear, they heard the video’s sound. In the other, they heard a sound like \"dah\" mixed with background talking.\n\nBy studying the brain’s response, the team created a model to predict how well kids would do on early reading tests. They tested 112 children, ages 3 to 14.\n\nThe 30-minute test was able to predict how well 3-year-olds performed on a language skill. It also showed how those same kids did a year later on reading tests. The researchers will keep watching these children to see how well they learn to read over time.\n\nThe test also worked for older children. Their EEG results matched their current reading ability in school. It even identified a few kids who had already been diagnosed with learning disabilities.\n\nHearing lots of spoken words is important for learning to read. This study is part of a bigger effort to find early warning signs of reading problems, said Brett Miller, a researcher at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, which helped pay for the study.\n\nBut don’t expect EEG tests for preschoolers anytime soon. These machines are mostly used by brain specialists, and the test is expensive and complex. More research is still needed, Kraus said.\n\nHer ultimate hope is to study how a baby’s brain reacts to sound, possibly as part of routine hearing tests done shortly after birth."

        "gpt": "Climbing Mount Everest is tough, but living on the Tibetan plateau is even harder for most people. Yet, Tibetans have lived there for thousands of years. A new study says they can survive there because of a special gene they got from an ancient human relative.\n\nThe study, published in *Nature*, found that Tibetans share a piece of DNA with a long-lost group of humans called Denisovans. This DNA contains a gene, called EPAS1, which helps Tibetans live at high altitudes better than most people.\n\nScientists only discovered Denisovans about four years ago when they studied DNA from a finger bone found in a cave in Siberia. Denisovans were similar to modern humans and Neanderthals but were a different species. Like Neanderthals, Denisovans had children with early humans. For example, people from Papua New Guinea today still carry about 5% Denisovan DNA.\n\nNow, scientists know that Tibetans also got some of their DNA from Denisovans. In the study, scientists took blood samples from 40 Tibetans and studied the EPAS1 gene. They compared it with DNA from 1,000 people from 26 different human groups. They found the gene only in two Han Chinese people and no one else.\n\nThe scientists realized natural selection alone couldn't explain this. The DNA was too different from other groups. So, they checked if the gene came from Neanderthals or Denisovans, and they found it matched Denisovan DNA.\n\nHow did this gene get into Tibetans? Scientists tested two ideas: Did Denisovans and Tibetans share a common ancestor with the gene? Or did Tibetans get the gene by having children with Denisovans? The second idea is more likely. Denisovans and early humans split from a common ancestor about 500,000 years ago. If the gene had stayed in both groups for that long, it would have been much shorter due to DNA changes over time. But this gene is still very long, which means it was passed on more recently, probably through mating.\n\nOnce Tibetans got the gene, it spread quickly because it helped them survive the tough conditions of high-altitude living. High altitudes, like the Tibetan plateau, have 40% less oxygen than sea level. EPAS1 helps Tibetans live there without the health problems that affect most people.\n\nAt high altitudes, most people produce too many red blood cells to carry oxygen, which can cause problems like high blood pressure and strokes. Tibetans, however, produce fewer red blood cells, thanks to EPAS1. This keeps them healthier in the thin air, though scientists still don’t fully understand how the gene works.\n\nWhat’s clear is that this gene, passed down from Denisovans, plays a big role in helping Tibetans live in such extreme conditions. Scientists think other groups in Asia might also have Denisovan DNA. For example, China has many ethnic groups that haven’t been studied yet.\n\nThis discovery is part of a bigger story about human evolution. For a long time, scientists thought Neanderthals and Denisovans had no connection to modern humans. Now, they know that interbreeding with these ancient relatives gave humans important genes that helped them adapt to different environments.\n\n\"We’ve come full circle,\" said Abigail Bigham, an anthropologist. \"Interbreeding didn’t just happen — it led to big changes that helped humans survive.\""

        "gpt": "DALLAS — Kids today are not as fit as their parents were. A study of millions of children around the world shows kids today can't run as fast or as far as their parents could when they were young.\n\nOn average, kids now take 90 seconds longer to run a mile than kids did 30 years ago. Fitness for the heart has dropped 5% every 10 years since 1975 for kids aged 9 to 17.\n\nThe American Heart Association shared this research at a meeting on Tuesday. It’s the first study to show that kids’ fitness has gone down all over the world in the last 30 years.\n\n\"This makes sense because kids are less active now,\" said Dr. Stephen Daniels, a children’s doctor from the University of Colorado and spokesperson for the heart group.\n\nExperts say kids aged 6 and older should get 60 minutes of exercise every day. But only one-third of American kids are doing this.\n\n\"Kids don’t have enough chances to stay active during the day,\" Daniels said. \"Many schools don’t have gym class anymore because of money issues. Some schools only have recess for exercise.\"\n\nSam Kass, a White House chef and leader of Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move program, said schools are very important for helping kids stay active. \"We have the most inactive generation of kids in history,\" Kass said at the meeting on Monday.\n\nThe study was led by Grant Tomkinson, a fitness expert from the University of South Australia. Researchers looked at 50 studies about running fitness, which is a way to measure heart health and endurance. These studies included 25 million kids aged 9 to 17 from 28 countries between 1964 and 2010.\n\nThe studies measured how far kids could run in 5 to 15 minutes and how fast they could run certain distances. Researchers found that kids today are about 15% less fit than their parents were.\n\n\"The changes are the same for boys and girls and for all ages,\" Tomkinson said. But the results were different in different parts of the world. Fitness levels have stopped dropping in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. In North America, the drop may have slowed in recent years. But in China, fitness keeps going down, while in Japan, it has stayed about the same.\n\nIn China, kids are getting slower and heavier. Experts blame this on too much focus on school test scores and more time spent indoors playing video games or surfing the internet.\n\nIn 2010, Chinese male college students ran 1,000 meters about 14 to 15 seconds slower than students from 10 years earlier. Female students ran 800 meters about 12 seconds slower.\n\nIn Japan, fitness has also gone down since the 1980s. Motoaki Nito, a government official for youth sports, said the government has encouraged schools to focus on fitness. This has helped kids become a little stronger, though they are still not as fit as kids in the 1980s.\n\nTomkinson and Daniels said obesity might be part of the problem. Being overweight makes it harder to run or do other exercises. Watching too much TV, playing video games, and not having safe places to play outside could also be reasons.\n\nOther studies show that people everywhere are becoming less active. \"Fitness is poor in adults and even worse in young people,\" said Dr. Ulf Ekelund from Norway. This is especially true in the United States and Eastern Europe.\n\nThe World Health Organization says 80% of young people worldwide are not getting enough exercise."

He’s been a TV star for over 30 years, worked as the tourism minister, led the Andean Community, and even ran for president twice. Now, at 69, he has taken on a new job: making Ecuador happier.\n\nSince 2013, Ehlers has been the State Secretary of Buen Vivir, which means \"good living\" or \"well-being.\" He works with a team of 30 people, has a $2 million yearly budget, and reports directly to President Rafael Correa. His goal is to make Ecuadorians feel more content.\n\nWhile some people laugh at the idea of a \"happiness job,\" Ehlers takes it very seriously. He says people need to focus on living well, not just having \"more and better\" things. He believes that chasing endless growth and consumerism harms mental health and the planet.\n\nEhlers says we need to change how we think about progress, development, and happiness. He warns that if we don’t, we could damage the planet beyond repair. Many countries and top universities are now studying happiness as a serious topic. Ecuador even included the idea of \"Good Life,\" based on an indigenous concept, in its 2008 constitution.\n\nEcuador is one of the few countries, along with Bhutan and Venezuela, that has made happiness a government priority. Bhutan, for example, measures \"gross happiness\" instead of just economic growth. Scientists say happiness depends on things like income, health, generosity, freedom, and social support, but good governance is also key.\n\nSome people doubt whether a ministry for happiness can really make a difference. John Helliwell, a happiness expert, says having such a ministry isn’t enough to make people happy, but it can help focus attention on important issues like well-being and sustainability.\n\nEhlers and his team have taken some real steps to improve life in Ecuador. For example, they worked with health officials to create a stoplight system for food packaging. This system uses green, yellow, and red labels to show if foods are healthy or unhealthy. The idea is to help people make better food choices, though some companies didn’t like it at first.\n\nThe ministry also plans to teach children values like honesty, forgiveness, and perseverance. They will introduce meditation in schools, starting with six-year-olds meditating for six minutes a day. Ehlers says this isn’t about religion but about helping kids reconnect with themselves and nature.\n\nThe ministry’s main project is a TV program that promotes a happy lifestyle. However, not everyone supports this work. Some critics say the ministry is a waste of money and call it unnecessary during tough economic times. Others see it as part of the government’s socialist policies, which are controversial.\n\nEcuador is ranked 48th in the World Happiness Report, which measures well-being in countries. Bhutan, despite focusing on happiness for 40 years, ranks only 79th out of 158 countries. Venezuela, which also has a happiness ministry, ranks 23rd, but its happiness levels are dropping due to economic problems.\n\nEven if happiness ministries don’t always work perfectly, they can help people and governments think about what really matters. Bhutan, for example, helped create World Happiness Day in 2011 to promote these ideas worldwide.\n\nEhlers says his job is tough, especially during challenging times. But he believes it’s important. \"We have so many friends on social media, but no one to hug,\" he says. \"That’s the sad part of modern life. We need to make time to connect with each other.\""

        "gpt": "PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — In a small, dark bar in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, Ros Choun tried to explain how he ended up there.\n\n\"They took my whole life, and I can't do anything about it,\" he said.\n\nChoun looks Cambodian, but he spent almost his entire life in the United States. At 35, he says he still feels American. His family moved to the U.S. in the early 1980s to escape the Khmer Rouge, a brutal time in Cambodia's history when nearly 2 million people died.\n\n\"I was only 6 months old when we left Cambodia,\" he said. \"I'm American. But nobody told us that going to prison could get us sent back to Cambodia.\" His voice was angry, and his eyes were sad.\n\nSince 2002, hundreds of Cambodians have been deported from the U.S. to Cambodia. This started because of a strict immigration law passed in 1996, during President Bill Clinton’s time, and a 2001 agreement after the September 11 attacks. The agreement allows the U.S. to deport Cambodians who committed serious crimes if they never became U.S. citizens.\n\nMany refugees who came to the U.S. in the late 1970s and 1980s didn’t know that having asylum or residency was not the same as being a citizen.\n\n\"I didn’t know about this until 2011,\" said Aun Khoy, 51, a deportee. He moved to the U.S. as a teenager but was sent back to Cambodia two years ago for a crime he committed decades ago.\n\nAt first, deportations were rare, but now they happen often. Since 2009, about 10 people a month have been deported. In total, around 400 people have been sent back to Cambodia, and another 2,000 could be deported because of their criminal records.\n\n\"Many of them are just living their normal lives — working, studying, raising families,\" said Bill Herod, an American pastor in Cambodia who helps deportees. \"But any day, immigration officers could come for them. It’s unfair, but it’s legal.\"\n\nChoun was taken from his family’s home in Atlanta three years ago. After 18 months in detention, he was sent to Cambodia. His crime? When he was 16, he fired a gun at school to scare some bullies. He was tried as an adult and spent seven years in prison. After his release, he stayed out of trouble for 10 years, working and paying taxes. \"I didn’t even get a traffic ticket,\" he said, shaking his head.\n\nChoun says some deportees have even worse stories. \"We have a 72-year-old grandfather here. He hit his son for joining a gang in 1986. He was a teacher, but now he just drinks all day. You can’t get a job here if you’re 70.\"\n\nThe Returnee Integration Support Center says deportees are between 25 and 82 years old. Many were involved in gangs, drugs, or violent crimes while living in the U.S.\n\n\"They were placed in big cities in the U.S. with little support, and that led to trouble,\" Herod explained.\n\nWhen deportees arrive in Cambodia, they have almost nothing. U.S. marshals escort them off the plane, but after that, they’re on their own. Many spend their first weeks in small, bare rooms above the support center’s office near the airport. After that, they must find a way to survive in a poor country.\n\n\"The Cambodian government has too many problems to care about them,\" said Keo Sarith, the center’s program director.\n\nKen Touch, 39, arrived in Cambodia a year ago. He hadn’t been there since he was a baby. \"I’m just living day by day,\" he said, sitting in a coffee shop. His tattoos make him stand out.\n\nIn 2000, Touch got into a bar fight and shot someone in the leg. He spent 10 years in prison and another year in detention before being deported. \"I knew I’d get deported after prison. It was always on my mind,\" he said.\n\nTouch struggles to make ends meet. His family sends him some money, and he earns a little by giving motorbike rides. \"I have 13 days to make it to the end of the month. I eat the same food every day, but I’ll survive,\" he said.\n\nFor Touch and others, the hardest part is knowing they can never go back to the U.S., even if someone in their family dies. \"People in U.S. prisons can see their families on weekends or go to funerals,\" he said. \"If my parents die, I can’t even attend their funerals.\"\n\nMany deportees struggle with life in Cambodia. They are far from their families and don’t know the language. It’s hard to find work.\n\n\"About 10 percent manage to settle down, find jobs, and start families,\" Herod said. \"But for most, life is very hard.\"\n\nSome deportees have taken their own lives or gotten into trouble again. Seventeen are currently in Cambodian prisons for crimes committed after being deported.\n\nHerod said he once lost the sight in one eye while trying to stop a deportee from drinking poison. \"That man later succeeded in killing himself,\" he said sadly.\n\nChoun finds life especially hard because he left his three children behind in Atlanta. He doesn’t have the money to see them. \"I can’t explain everything to my kids. I just tell them I’m on a work trip and hope that someday I can go back, even just for a visit,\" he said."

        "gpt": "BALTIMORE — Ray Rice was fired by the Baltimore Ravens on Monday and banned from the NFL indefinitely after a video showed him hitting his then-fiancée in February.\n\nThe blurry video, released by TMZ Sports, shows Rice and Janay Palmer in an elevator at an Atlantic City casino. They hit each other, and then Rice knocks Palmer down into a railing. An earlier video from TMZ showed Rice dragging Palmer, now his wife, out of the elevator at the Revel casino, which closed on September 2.\n\nThe Ravens said they had not seen the new video earlier. Later on Monday, they released a short statement:  \n\"The Baltimore Ravens terminated the contract of RB Ray Rice this afternoon.\"\n\nThe NFL also took action. On Twitter, they announced that Commissioner Roger Goodell had suspended Rice indefinitely after seeing the new video.\n\nCoach John Harbaugh was expected to speak Monday night after practice.\n\nIn July, the NFL had suspended Rice for two games for domestic violence. This punishment was widely criticized for being too light.\n\nNFL spokesman Greg Aiello said on Monday that the league had asked the police for all information about the incident, including the elevator video. \"That video was not given to us, and no one in our office saw it until today,\" he said.\n\nGoodell had said in August that the NFL relies on all the facts they can get when deciding punishments. He admitted the police often have more information than the league does.\n\nRice’s lawyer, Michael Diamondstein, did not comment when asked by the Associated Press.\n\nRice, who is 27 years old, was charged with felony assault after the incident. In May, he was allowed to join a program to avoid jail time, which could also erase the charge from his record.\n\nGoodell faced backlash for not being tough enough on Rice. In August, he wrote to NFL team owners, admitting he made a mistake. \"My decision made people doubt our sincerity and our commitment to fighting domestic violence,\" he wrote. \"I take responsibility for that. I didn’t get it right. We have to do better.\"\n\nThe NFL has since changed its rules. First-time offenders for domestic violence now face a six-game suspension.\n\nRice began his suspension on Sunday, when the Ravens lost 23-16 to the Cincinnati Bengals. He was supposed to return after Thursday’s game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, but during his suspension, he could not be with the team and had to train on his own.\n\nRice hasn’t spoken much to the media since his arrest. On July 31, he apologized, calling his actions \"inexcusable.\" He said, \"This is something I will have to live with for the rest of my life.\"\n\nHe added, \"That’s not the kind of man I am. That’s not how my mom raised me. I let her down, I let my wife down, I let my daughter down, I let my wife’s parents down, I let my teammates down, and I let the Baltimore community down. I let so many people down because of 30 seconds of my life that I can never take back.\""

        "gpt": "Apple Inc. is asking big music companies to release new songs only on its iTunes store at first. This would mean the songs wouldn’t be on streaming services like Spotify or Beats Music right away, according to people who know about the situation.\n\nApple says streaming music services are hurting their download sales. They want music companies to set a time when new songs can only be bought online before they go to streaming platforms.\n\nMusic experts, who didn’t want to be named because they’re worried about upsetting Apple, say this idea is like what movie companies do when they release films for home viewing. Apple, based in California, is trying to stay ahead in the fast-changing digital music world.\n\n“These are changing times, and everyone is trying new ideas, whether it’s iTunes, Spotify, or the music companies,” said Irving Azoff, a music manager for stars like the Eagles and Christina Aguilera.\n\niTunes is responsible for about 80% of all music downloads in the U.S. But after years of growth, download sales started dropping in 2013 and have continued to go down. In the first two months of this year, song downloads fell 12%, and album downloads dropped 13%, according to Nielsen SoundScan.\n\nExperts say the drop is caused by the rise of streaming services and more competition for listeners’ attention. Many people now use their smartphones, like a modern version of the old Sony Walkman, to stream music. About 48% of smartphone users stream music daily, compared to 42% who download it, says Nielsen.\n\nEven though Apple makes the most smartphones, more Americans now use Android phones with Google’s software, according to the Yankee Group. When people switch to Android, they lose easy access to Apple’s iTunes store.\n\nApple has been talking to music companies and artists to get exclusive deals to help their sales. Apple did not comment on this report.\n\nJim Guerinot, a music manager for acts like No Doubt, says Apple has always been clear about wanting special content. \"They’re very aggressive about doing something different to stand out,\" he said.\n\nApple has used Beyonce’s fifth album as an example of their strategy. Her album was only available on iTunes at first and sold very quickly, becoming the fastest-selling album on the platform. However, stores like Target and Amazon didn’t sell the CD version because they were upset about the exclusive release.\n\nRecently, rapper Kid Cudi released his album \"Satellite Flight\" only on iTunes and other download stores. It debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard charts, selling 87,000 copies.\n\nIn contrast, rapper Schoolboy Q used Spotify to promote his album \"Oxymoron,\" which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard charts, selling nearly 139,000 copies in its first week. Fans had streamed 3.3 million of his songs on Spotify before the album came out.\n\nSpotify’s Chief Content Officer, Ken Parks, said it’s not a good idea to force people to buy music in one way when they clearly prefer streaming. \"It doesn’t work for anyone,\" he said.\n\nMusic expert Mark Mulligan said streaming is taking away Apple’s best customers. \"Streaming isn’t replacing downloads entirely,\" he said. \"But it’s targeting the people who spend the most on downloads — Apple’s most valuable customers.\""

        "gpt": "What was once just a question is now becoming real: What would happen to the economy with a $15-an-hour minimum wage?\n\nActivists and politicians believe a $15 wage could reduce poverty and help the economy. Business owners worry it could hurt small businesses, cause layoffs, and make it harder to survive in tough times. The truth is not that simple. A $15 wage would affect the economy in ways that are neither as bad nor as good as people claim.\n\nThe idea of a higher minimum wage has grown in recent years. Cities like Seattle, San Francisco, and Los Angeles have passed laws to raise the minimum wage to $15 over the next few years. This is more than double the current federal minimum wage of $7.25.\n\nOther cities, like Chicago and Washington, D.C., have raised wages, but not as high. Many other places, like New York and Oregon, might follow soon.\n\nThis movement comes after years of low wages and a slow recovery since the 2009 recession. Like the Gilded Age in the late 1800s, recent decades have seen big income gains for the wealthy, but very little for most people.\n\nRaising wages would help reduce inequality and lift many people out of poverty. About 60% of hourly workers, or 44 million people, earn less than $15 an hour. If wages rose to $15, nearly half of them would see a 50% pay increase.\n\nThis raise wouldn’t just help teenagers or young workers. Over 8.4 million workers earning less than $10 an hour are between 25 and 54 years old. Most are women, many with children.\n\nBut higher wages could reduce government benefits like food aid or child-care help for low-wage workers. Workers might earn more, but lose some of this support.\n\nWith more money, people would spend more, boosting the economy. However, prices might rise as businesses pass on higher labor costs to customers. For example, when Oakland raised its minimum wage from $9 to $12.25, many stores raised prices. A food business owner there increased prices by $2 to $3 per plate to afford the higher wages.\n\nIn the long run, some workers might lose jobs as companies cut back to handle higher costs. A government report estimated that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 could cost 500,000 jobs. A $15 wage could result in millions of job losses.\n\nSome economists say $15 might work in expensive cities like Seattle, but it could be harder for smaller, less wealthy areas.\n\nHigher wages might push some struggling businesses, especially small ones, to close. But stronger businesses might survive and even grow, benefiting from more customers spending money.\n\nSome companies might outsource jobs or use machines to replace workers. This could mean fewer low-wage jobs but more higher-paying tech jobs.\n\nNo one knows exactly how these changes will play out. But as the push for a $15 minimum wage spreads, workers and businesses are starting to imagine what life would be like with higher wages."

        "gpt": "LOS ANGELES — Members of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship say they want to create a friendly space for both Christians and non-Christians on college campuses, which can sometimes feel lonely. They also want to share their faith.\n\nBut the group says its future is at risk because it requires its leaders to share Christian beliefs. This fall, California State University (Cal State) campuses stopped recognizing InterVarsity and other Christian groups because they wouldn’t follow a rule. The rule says all clubs must allow any student to join or become a leader, no matter their beliefs. Fraternities and sororities, however, can still choose members based on gender.\n\nAccording to this rule, anyone could lead any group, even if they don’t share the group’s purpose. For example, a Republican could lead a Democratic club, or a non-musician could lead a music club.\n\nGroups like InterVarsity can still meet on campus without official recognition, but they lose free or discounted meeting spaces. They also can’t participate in campus events or receive funding from student organizations.\n\nInterVarsity students feel this puts them at a disadvantage. They believe rules meant to protect religious freedom are actually being used to limit it.\n\n\"We could sign the papers,\" said Jasmine Kim, a 22-year-old music student at Long Beach. \"But it's about staying true to who we are as Christians. A non-Christian probably wouldn’t want to lead a Christian group anyway.\"\n\nThe debate highlights a bigger question: How far should universities go to enforce rules against bias? And should religious groups at public universities follow the same rules as other clubs?\n\nInterVarsity says its membership is open to everyone, but its leaders must share Christian beliefs. Gregory L. Jao, a leader in the group, explained that being Christian is as important to their leaders as gender is to members of a fraternity or sorority. He believes Cal State’s rule discriminates against religious groups.\n\n\"It's ironic,\" Jao said. \"In the name of inclusion, they’re excluding us because of our beliefs. A truly inclusive university should respect people’s beliefs.\"\n\nThis issue isn’t unique to Cal State, which has 23 campuses and 450,000 students. Other schools like Vanderbilt and Tufts have also stopped recognizing Christian groups for similar reasons. The University of California system might soon face the same issue.\n\nSome experts say this reflects a trend toward reducing differences, especially when it comes to religion. They argue that groups should have the right to choose leaders who share their values. Others believe universities are right to apply the same rules to all groups, especially when public funds are involved.\n\nCal State officials say their rule follows state law, which bans discrimination in programs funded by the state. While some states like Texas and Ohio have made exceptions for religious groups, California has not.\n\nInterVarsity only recently started requiring leaders to sign a statement of faith, after Cal State gave groups a year to comply with the rule. Cal State says some groups used that time to change their rules to go against the policy. InterVarsity disagrees but admits some chapters may have worded their policies differently.\n\nEven with the rule, clubs can still set some requirements for leaders. For example, a Bible study leader must know the Bible, and a music club leader must have musical skills. There’s no record of anyone trying to take over a religious club.\n\nOther student groups have also objected to the rule. For example, some Democratic clubs wanted to keep out Republican leaders, and a veterans’ group wanted to limit membership to veterans. Most campus clubs, however, have accepted the new rules.\n\nSome groups, like Hillel (a Jewish organization) and the Muslim Student Association, say they welcome anyone as leaders. They haven’t had issues because non-believers usually don’t feel they could contribute fully as leaders.\n\nInterVarsity students remain firm in their beliefs. The group’s national office is helping chapters pay for meeting spaces. For example, the Long Beach chapter had to pay $3,500 to rent a lecture hall for five weeks. Students are also using social media to spread their message.\n\n\"This group feels like my family,\" said Aaron Ridder, a 20-year-old biology student at Long Beach. \"My faith helps me express myself. We can’t give up on this. If we do, we won’t be the same.\""

They were there to mark the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington and to call for more progress in the fight for civil rights.\n\nUnder sunny blue skies, the crowd gathered near the Lincoln Memorial. This is where Martin Luther King Jr. gave his famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech. Speakers encouraged the crowd to stay involved in the push for racial equality.\n\nRep. John Lewis, the only speaker still alive from the 1963 march, energized the crowd. He spoke against a recent Supreme Court decision that removed part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Lewis shared his own struggles, saying, \"I gave a little blood on that bridge in Selma, Ala.\" He was referring to the 1965 \"Bloody Sunday\" march where protesters were attacked. \"I got arrested 40 times, beaten, and left unconscious. But I'm not tired. I am ready to fight, and you must fight too,\" he said.\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder agreed, saying the fight for justice must continue. He stressed the importance of ensuring everyone has the right to vote and is treated fairly by the justice system.\n\nAs the morning went on, more people arrived. Officials said they expected at least 700 buses from out of town. Hilary Shelton from the NAACP estimated over 100,000 people were there by noon.\n\nThe atmosphere was both cheerful and thoughtful. People sat on blankets and chairs, listening to speeches and cheering. Many wore T-shirts or carried signs about the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the death of Trayvon Martin. Vendors sold items related to the March on Washington, Trayvon Martin, and President Barack Obama.\n\nEmma Daniels, 70, wore a cap with buttons from the 1963 march. She stood with her family and remembered attending the original march. \"I wanted my children to feel what I felt — the hope for change,\" she said. Daniels noted that Saturday felt more relaxed than 50 years ago. Back then, many people had to travel through the segregated South, which made the journey tense.\n\nHer daughter, Melanie Marshall, said the event made her appreciate the right to gather peacefully. \"In some countries, people are fighting and dying in the streets. We’re lucky to come together like this,\" she said.\n\nAmber Brown, 43, drove five hours from North Carolina with her kids. She wanted them to learn about history and the sacrifices people made for their freedoms. Darryl Simmons, 21, also came with students from his college in South Carolina. \"I wanted to relive history,\" he said. \"We’re here for justice.\"\n\nSaturday’s event was just the beginning. On Wednesday, August 28, the actual anniversary, another big crowd is expected. President Obama will speak at the same spot where King gave his speech.\n\nObama, the first African-American president, is expected to talk about the progress and challenges in achieving King’s dream. King dreamed of a nation where people are judged by their character, not their skin color.\n\nObama usually avoids discussing race directly, but after the Zimmerman verdict, he spoke about why it affected many African Americans. When asked about progress since King’s speech, Obama said, \"We’ve come a long way. I’m proof of that. The diversity in this room shows it. But there’s still work to do.\"\n\nHe explained that the effects of slavery and segregation still create barriers. African-American poverty rates remain high, along with those for Latinos and Native Americans. He said it’s important for everyone to support smart policies to help these communities.\n\nObama also warned against political divisions. Some people think the government takes from one group to give to another, he said. \"We must fight against this mindset and work together, no matter our race,\" he said."

The world is filled with war, violence, and betrayal, and it’s hard to find someone who has truly made things better.\n\nIn many parts of the world, efforts to stop fighting have failed. In the Middle East, peace talks between Israel and Palestine broke down again, and fighting in Gaza caused more suffering. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry gave up on trying to help. In Syria, a United Nations diplomat, Lakhdar Brahimi, tried to end the war but quit in May after peace talks went nowhere. His replacement, Staffan de Mistura, hasn’t been able to restart the talks.\n\nThere were no great leaders like Nelson Mandela or Mikhail Gorbachev this year. Religious leaders also didn’t make a big impact, although Pope Francis was nominated for his efforts to help the poor. However, he has only been Pope for 19 months, and even Pope John Paul II wasn’t recognized for his long work for peace.\n\nSome controversial figures were nominated but were not chosen. For example, Chelsea Manning, who leaked government documents, is in prison. Edward Snowden, who revealed secrets about government spying, is living in Russia and is both praised and criticized. The Russian protest group Pussy Riot was also nominated in the past but not chosen.\n\nDespite the challenges, there were a record 278 nominations this year, including 47 organizations. When no individual stands out, organizations often get more attention. Some of the top guesses for winners included a Japanese group working to keep peace in their country’s constitution, an independent Russian newspaper called *Novaya Gazeta*, and well-known activist Malala Yousafzai.\n\nMalala, a young Pakistani girl, was shot by the Taliban for standing up for girls’ education. Other possible winners included Denis Mukwege, a doctor in Congo who helps women harmed by violence, and José Mujica, the president of Uruguay who donates most of his salary to help the poor.\n\nAnother name mentioned was Helmut Kohl, the leader of West Germany during its peaceful reunification after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Some believed it would be a good time to honor him for his role in bringing Germany together.\n\n**Update:** Malala Yousafzai and Kailash Satyarthi won the Nobel Peace Prize. The Nobel Committee honored them for their fight for children’s rights and education. Malala, now 17, is the youngest person ever to win the prize. Kailash Satyarthi, from India, has worked for years to protect children from exploitation and has led peaceful protests to improve their lives."

        "gpt": "WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama is creating new rules for how local police can get leftover military equipment, like armored vehicles, assault rifles, and body armor. Police in Ferguson, Missouri, used this kind of gear during protests last summer.\n\nObama is also suggesting a $263 million plan over three years to improve police training and increase the use of body cameras. These cameras record police actions with the public. The plan includes $75 million to help buy up to 50,000 cameras. If cameras had been used, they might have given more details about the August shooting of an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, by a white police officer in Ferguson.\n\nThe president’s decision comes after a White House review found problems with how military equipment is given to police. The review showed there are unclear rules, and not all police are trained to use the equipment properly.\n\nThis review was released a week after a grand jury decided not to charge the Ferguson officer, Darren Wilson, in the shooting of Michael Brown. The decision caused protests in Ferguson and across the U.S. Many people were upset about the police using military equipment during the protests.\n\nNow, Obama is asking his team to make a list of military gear that can be used for police work. He also wants local leaders to approve the use of this equipment and ensure police are trained to use it safely.\n\nThe new rules will be ready in about four months. They will come as an executive order, which means the president is setting the rules for the Pentagon and other federal agencies that give military equipment to police.\n\nOne official said, \"The president wants to add more accountability to the program.\" Right now, there aren’t enough rules to make sure the equipment is used correctly.\n\nIn Ferguson, using military gear made things worse between police and protesters. People in the community questioned why police showed up to peaceful protests with riot gear and weapons. This led Obama to order the review of how military equipment is given to local police.\n\nThe report found that federal programs giving out military equipment are not consistent. It also questioned whether police know how to use the equipment properly.\n\nObama talked about the report and his new plans in meetings with his Cabinet, young civil rights leaders, and community leaders. The main focus was on how to rebuild trust between police and the public.\n\nThe president asked for an order requiring local leaders, not just police, to approve military equipment like small weapons and armored vehicles before it is brought to their communities. Police would also need to complete serious training and write reports after major incidents involving this equipment.\n\nObama is also starting a task force to find ways to reduce crime while improving trust between police and communities. The group will be led by Charles H. Ramsey, the Philadelphia police commissioner, and Laurie Robinson, a former justice official."

        "gpt": "WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court decided on Thursday that natural human genes cannot be patented. This decision could allow more freedom for scientific research and businesses.\n\nThe court's unanimous decision made a clear difference between natural genes and lab-made ones. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote, \"A natural DNA segment is a product of nature and cannot be patented just because it is isolated.\" However, synthetic DNA, called complementary DNA (cDNA), can still be patented because it is man-made.\n\nThe decision affected a company called Myriad Genetics, based in Utah. Myriad had patents on two genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, which are linked to a higher risk of breast and ovarian cancer. These patents gave Myriad control over who could work with these genes. Scientists and a group called the Association for Molecular Pathology sued Myriad, arguing that the patents limited research and made genetic testing more expensive.\n\nSandra S. Park, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, said, \"We are thrilled.\" She explained that the court’s ruling could lower the cost of genetic testing and allow more companies to develop tests for cancer and other conditions. Dr. Harry Ostrer, a medical geneticist, added that the decision will make testing cheaper and improve quality.\n\nThe ruling may also affect patents on about 4,000 other human genes and even some non-human genes. However, Myriad pointed out that patents on cDNA and methods for isolating genes are still valid. Myriad's CEO, Peter D. Meldrum, emphasized that the company’s genetic tests remain protected.\n\nMyriad had used advanced tools to find the BRCA genes, which are linked to a much higher risk of breast cancer. For example, women with BRCA mutations have up to an 85% chance of developing breast cancer, compared to 12% for the average woman. Actress Angelina Jolie recently chose to have a double mastectomy after testing positive for these genes.\n\nMyriad charged about $3,300 for its genetic test, although insurance often covered the cost. Because of the patents, other scientists were restricted from working with the BRCA genes.\n\nThe court explained that even though Myriad’s discovery of the BRCA genes was important, it did not make the genes something new that could be patented. Justice Thomas wrote, \"A groundbreaking discovery does not make the genes a new creation.\"\n\nSome lawyers noted that the ruling does not affect patents on methods for working with genes or new uses of DNA. Barbara Rudolph, another intellectual property lawyer, said the decision benefits companies that focus on creating synthetic DNA. She added that the court tried to balance whether patents help or hurt innovation.\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia wrote a short opinion agreeing with the decision but admitted he did not fully understand the scientific details."

        "gpt": "CHICAGO — When the Chicago Blackhawks play, Michelle Secor is dressed in her team gear and watches every moment. \"I grew up on the South Side, so I cheer for our Chicago teams,\" she said while taking a break from watching the Stanley Cup finals at a Bridgeport bar. \"Bulls, Sox, Bears, Hawks. It's part of who I am.\"\n\nSecor, 46, is Mexican-American and one of the growing number of minorities who enjoy hockey. She only started watching a few years ago but is now a big fan. \"It feels good to see a Chicago team win—race doesn’t matter,\" she said.\n\nHockey, with its Canadian roots, has been mostly played and watched by white people, experts say. But this is changing. The NHL says there are more minority players now—50 in 2009—than ever before. There’s also been a small increase in minority fans.\n\nThe Blackhawks have three Black players, more than any other NHL team: goalie Ray Emery, forward Jamal Mayers, and defenseman Johnny Oduya. Dustin Byfuglien, a Black player from Minnesota drafted by the Blackhawks in 2003, also helped attract young Black fans to hockey.\n\nIn the U.S., the NHL says it has 58 million fans—people who’ve watched, listened to, or attended a game in the past year. Of those, 9.4% are Latino, up slightly since 2010 when the Blackhawks last won the Stanley Cup. About 8.3% are African-American, and while that percentage hasn’t changed, the total number of Black fans has grown because the overall fan base is bigger.\n\n\"We’re getting more fans from different backgrounds,\" said Nirva Milord, the NHL’s communications director.\n\nThe NHL doesn’t target specific ethnic groups, said Ken Martin, Vice President of Community Affairs. But they’re trying to grow the sport by reaching kids in cities. In Chicago, the Blackhawks’ success has helped introduce hockey to new neighborhoods. \"Winning makes the game more accessible,\" Martin said.\n\nHowever, challenges remain. Hockey is expensive, and there aren’t many places in minority communities to learn or play the sport, said Richard Lapchick, director of the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport. \"Hockey isn’t as common in these areas as baseball, football, or basketball,\" he said. \"There aren’t enough rinks in cities where many African-Americans and Hispanics live. The NHL has started programs, but it’s a slow process.\"\n\nThere have also been few star players of color in hockey, Lapchick added. According to the NHL, there are now 44 minority players in the league. Of these, 22 are Black, 11 are Native/Aboriginal, 4 are Hispanic, 3 are Asian, 2 are West Asian/Arab, 1 is Inuit, and 1 is South Asian/Indian. \"Once there are more African-American stars, it will help grow the fan base,\" Lapchick said.\n\nThe cost of hockey is another barrier. \"You can’t just play hockey in your backyard,\" said Jimmy Terracino, director of the Bobby Hull Ice Rink in Cicero. \"You need a rink, skates, sticks, helmets, and pads. It’s expensive, and that stops many people from playing.\"\n\nStill, efforts are being made in Chicago to get more minorities into hockey. Youth leagues at Johnny's IceHouse are teaching local kids to play. In Cicero, a town where most people are of Mexican descent, a $3.5 million ice rink rents skates and gear, making the sport more affordable for Latino kids.\n\n\"The Blackhawks’ success is getting more kids interested in hockey,\" said Terracino.\n\nVic Ortiz, 46, a Mexican-American from the South Side, is a big Chicago sports fan. But for years, he didn’t follow the Blackhawks because games were too expensive, and most weren’t on TV. \"My family couldn’t afford to go, and the games weren’t on TV like the Bulls,\" he said. \"How could I learn about them?\"\n\nNow, Ortiz watches even when the Blackhawks aren’t in the playoffs. \"It’s about pride in Chicago,\" he said while wearing a Blackhawks shirt and hat.\n\nGertrude Johnson, 43, an African-American woman from the Near North Side, grew up watching the Bears and Bulls. Five years ago, her mom encouraged her to try hockey. \"At first, I only liked the fights,\" she said. But over time, she learned the rules and grew to love the speed and teamwork of the game.\n\n\"Anyone representing Chicago, we support them,\" Johnson said. \"People are saying, ‘Wow, the Blackhawks are doing great.’ In Chicago, we stick together.\""

People can swap fries for a salad at no extra cost. In some countries, like France, this option is already available.\n\nMcDonald's plans to offer these choices in 20 of its biggest markets worldwide, which make up 85% of its sales. The company, which has over 34,000 locations globally, says 30-50% of these areas will have the change in place within three years, and all will have it by 2020.\n\nThe announcement was made at the Clinton Global Initiative in New York City. CEO Don Thompson spoke on stage with former President Bill Clinton.\n\nThompson said McDonald's is working on other healthy side options that customers might like. He mentioned that fruits and vegetables, such as corn cups or kiwi sticks already sold in other countries, could be offered more widely.\n\n\"What will people actually eat?\" Thompson asked. \"We don’t want to just add something to the menu that no one chooses. We want people to eat it.\"\n\nMcDonald's also said it will use fun packaging to make healthier options more appealing to kids. For example, carrots might come in bright, colorful bags. Parents can still order soda with Happy Meals, but McDonald's will only promote milk, juice, and water on menu boards and in ads. All ads for kids will include a message about healthy eating or well-being.\n\nMargo Wootan, a nutrition expert, said removing soda as a promoted Happy Meal option is a big step that other fast-food chains should follow. However, she warned that McDonald's new focus on health might make the company seem healthier than it really is.\n\n\"These changes make the food a little better,\" Wootan said. \"But a hamburger, apples, and fries still aren’t what I’d call healthy.\"\n\nMcDonald's made the changes as it faces criticism for encouraging unhealthy eating. The company is also trying to keep up with changing tastes. Last year, McDonald's reported its first monthly sales drop in nearly 10 years, and sales have been uneven since.\n\nTo meet customer demands, McDonald's recently allowed egg whites in breakfast sandwiches and introduced chicken wraps for people looking for fresher, healthier options. Earlier this week, Burger King launched lower-calorie fries, showing that fast-food chains are responding to calls for healthier choices.\n\nMcDonald's ads aimed at kids have also raised concerns. A study by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found that McDonald's ads for kids often focus on toys and movies, not food. At a recent shareholders meeting, a 9-year-old girl asked Thompson to stop \"tricking\" kids into eating McDonald's food. The girl was with her mother, who works with a group pushing McDonald's to change its marketing to children.\n\nThompson said this criticism is a sensitive issue. He noted that the Alliance for a Healthier Generation, a group founded by the Clinton Global Initiative and the American Heart Association, asked McDonald's to use its advertising power to help kids eat better. McDonald's is now working with this group on its new health goals.\n\n\"Some people say, 'McDonald's, stop advertising to kids,'\" Thompson said. \"But we think, if we have such a big impact, why not use it to help kids?\"\n\nHowell Wechsler, the head of the Alliance for a Healthier Generation, said McDonald's commitments were developed over more than a year. He believes the changes could improve eating habits over time because of McDonald's huge influence worldwide."

Julia is autistic.  \n\nShe’s also a girl.  \n\nYou might think that’s unusual because autism is more often diagnosed in boys. According to experts, 1 in 68 kids in the U.S. is autistic. But boys are five times more likely to be diagnosed than girls.  \n\nSo why did Sesame Street make Julia a girl? Sherrie Westin, a leader at Sesame Street, explained that they chose Julia to be a girl to show that girls can have autism too. \"A lot of people think only boys can be autistic,\" she said. \"We wanted to change that idea.\"  \n\nTo help children understand autism, Sesame Street created a project called \"Sesame Street and Autism: See Amazing in All Children.\" This project includes videos, cards to teach important skills, and a digital storybook called *We Are Amazing, 1, 2, 3*. The storybook shows Julia playing with other Muppets. For now, Julia won’t appear on the TV show, but you can learn about her online.  \n\nThe team worked on this project for three years. They wanted to help families with autistic children and teach other kids about autism. Many autistic kids see the world differently. Some don’t talk, some avoid eye contact, and some are very sensitive to sounds. There are also different opinions about autism. Some groups see it as something to \"fix,\" while others see it as just another way of thinking.  \n\nSesame Street decided not to take sides in these debates. Instead, they focused on helping kids and families understand autism better. They worked with experts and different groups to create Julia. In the end, they gave Julia traits that are common for many autistic kids. Julia talks but doesn’t make much eye contact. She flaps her arms when she’s excited. She’s also curious and smart.  \n\nIn the storybook, Julia plays with Elmo. It shows how she does some things differently. For example, when she plays with a toy bus, she likes to spin the wheels over and over.  \n\nJulia also communicates in her own way. In one story, Elmo introduces Julia to Abby, but Julia keeps swinging on a swing and doesn’t look at Abby. Abby thinks Julia doesn’t like her, but Elmo explains, \"It’s just hard for her to talk when she’s swinging.\" When Julia finishes swinging, Abby tries again, but Julia looks down instead of answering. Elmo explains that Julia has autism and sometimes talks differently. He says, \"Sometimes Elmo uses fewer words and repeats things to talk to Julia.\"  \n\nDr. Jeanette Betancourt, another Sesame Street leader, said they will keep testing the materials to see how helpful they are for kids with and without autism. They want the project to help everyone learn and grow."

        "gpt": "SEATTLE — Do employers in Washington have to make room for their workers' religious needs, like giving holidays off or letting them pray during work hours?\n\nOn Tuesday, the Washington Supreme Court will hear a case that could clear up the state’s rules on religious discrimination at work.\n\nThe case was started by four workers at Gate Gourmet, a company that makes airline meals. For safety reasons, the company doesn’t let workers bring their own food to work. The four men — who are vegetarian, Orthodox Christian, Muslim, and Hindu — say the meals provided by the company made them eat pork and other foods against their religious beliefs.\n\nOne of the workers, Asegedew Gefe, an Orthodox Christian, has worked at the company’s warehouse at Sea-Tac Airport since 2010. He said, \"We’re not asking for much. Just tell us what we’re eating. If it’s broccoli, say it’s broccoli. If it’s pork, say it’s pork.\"\n\nBut does the company have to do that?  \n\nState law says employers can’t fire or refuse to hire someone because of their religion. But the law isn’t clear about whether employers have to accommodate religious practices at work. Some say the law already includes this protection, even if it’s not written down.\n\nThe ACLU of Washington and the Washington Employment Lawyers Association argue that ignoring religious accommodation would leave a big gap in the law.\n\nLast year, a judge dismissed the workers' case, saying state law doesn’t require companies to make room for religious practices. She based her decision on a similar case where a Christian woman sued a school district for asking her to lie, which went against her religion. That case was also dismissed.\n\nThe Supreme Court may have taken this case because it’s so important. Their decision could set rules for future cases, such as what kinds of accommodations employers must make and whether smaller companies can be sued under state law.\n\nThe company, which has 130 workers at Sea-Tac, said it takes its legal duties seriously but didn’t comment further because of the upcoming court arguments.\n\nThe workers’ lawyer, Aaron Rocke, says the law already protects religious rights. He argues that Washington should follow the majority of states and the federal government in requiring employers to accommodate religion.\n\nReligious-based workplace complaints have been increasing since 9/11. A recent poll found that common issues include being forced to work on religious holidays or attending events where the food doesn’t meet religious rules.\n\nWashington’s anti-discrimination law was passed in 1949, but it hasn’t been updated to clearly include religious accommodations, unlike federal law. In 1992, the state Supreme Court noted that the question of whether state law requires accommodation hadn’t been answered yet.\n\nLaura Lindstrand, a policy expert at the Human Rights Commission, said they always assumed employers had to make reasonable religious accommodations. The commission has even investigated complaints based on this understanding. But after last year’s court ruling, lawyers are more likely to file such cases in federal court, where the rules are clearer.\n\nSome past cases show how this works. For example, a Muslim security guard was fired for not shaving his beard, and a Red Robin server was fired for not covering religious tattoos. Both cases were filed in federal court.\n\nRocke filed the Gate Gourmet case in state court before the earlier ruling, believing state law protected his clients. He plans to seek class-action status for the case. The workers say the company’s no-food-from-home rule, partly based on federal security rules, led them to eat foods against their beliefs. \n\nFor example, Gefe and his co-workers thought they were eating beef or chicken but later found out it was pork. After complaints, the company started serving turkey meatballs but later stopped without warning. Workers say the company now labels meals, but the labels aren’t always accurate.\n\nThe workers are asking for damages, medical testing, and time off for religious cleansing. They also want the company to label food properly in the future."

        "gpt": "LOS ANGELES — The A-10 Thunderbolt II, also called the \"Warthog,\" is a tough-looking plane used to help troops on the ground. It has a huge gun in its nose that can destroy tanks and clear paths for soldiers. But now, this old plane might be retired.\n\nThe Air Force wants to stop using the A-10 to save money. They say they need funds for newer, high-tech weapons. The military is facing big budget cuts, so they have to decide whether to keep older planes like the A-10 or spend money on new ones.\n\nGetting rid of the A-10 fleet would save $3.5 billion over five years. However, many people, including members of Congress, are fighting to keep it. They argue the plane is too important for protecting troops. Some lawmakers even wrote a letter to military leaders, saying they are worried about retiring the A-10. A Facebook group called \"Save the A-10\" has over 4,000 supporters.\n\nThe A-10 is great at \"close-air support.\" This means it helps soldiers in battle by attacking enemy tanks and vehicles from the air. In July, two A-10s saved 60 soldiers in Afghanistan who were under heavy attack. The plane is also built to survive damage, with strong materials around the pilot and the ability to keep flying even if hit.\n\nBut the Air Force prefers new planes that can do many jobs, like the F-35 fighter jet. The F-35 is very advanced and can fight in the air, attack on the ground, and even hover like a helicopter. However, it costs twice as much to fly as the A-10 and isn't as good at protecting troops on the ground.\n\nThe military says cutting an entire fleet like the A-10 saves more money than smaller cuts. This includes cutting jobs for people who work on the planes. The A-10 program supports 6,000 jobs in the Air National Guard and many more across the country.\n\nThe F-35 program creates jobs too — about 127,000 in 47 states and Puerto Rico. This makes it hard for Congress to cut funding for the F-35, even though it's so expensive.\n\nThe big question is: Should the military spend money on newer, multi-use planes like the F-35, or keep older, single-use planes like the A-10? No matter what, some people in Congress and across the country will be unhappy."

On his birthday, he will be flying to Abu Dhabi for his first performance there.\n\n“We’ll get some warm weather, which is nice when you live in Canada,” said Lisiecki, speaking from his home in Calgary. He lives with his parents, who will travel with him to Abu Dhabi.\n\nAfter Abu Dhabi, Lisiecki will visit Spain and then Washington, D.C., where he will perform at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts on March 28. The recital is already sold out.\n\nA few days later, on April 7, Lisiecki will return to the Kennedy Center to play with the Philadelphia Orchestra. He will perform Edvard Grieg’s \"Piano Concerto in A Minor\" under the direction of Yannick Nézet-Séguin.\n\nThese performances are part of Lisiecki’s many achievements. At age 15, he signed a special recording deal with Deutsche Grammophon. Since then, he has played with famous orchestras like the New York Philharmonic, performed at the BBC Proms, and appeared at top venues around the world.\n\nIn 2014, when he made his debut with the Philadelphia Orchestra, he played three Mozart concertos in one week.\n\nLisiecki says he loves playing the piano. “It’s a different world: full of color and possibilities,” he said. He believes this joy connects with the audience.\n\nFor his March 28 recital, Lisiecki will play works by Ignacy Jan Paderewski, who was a composer, pianist, and Poland’s first prime minister after World War I. He will also play pieces by Mendelssohn and Bach, along with all 12 etudes from Chopin’s \"Opus 10.\"\n\nLisiecki explained that while the Chopin etudes are often played separately, they are rarely performed in order. Playing them this way helps listeners understand the overall idea behind the music. “It gives the audience a special feeling and shows Chopin’s genius,” he said."

This device records video when she makes driving mistakes.\n\nAt first, Chloe didn’t like it. The DriveCam sends videos of mistakes to her parents, who watch them online with her.\n\n“I felt like my privacy was taken away because it records me,” said Chloe, 16.\n\nNow, Chloe thinks it’s a good idea. She says it has made her a better driver. In the first week, the device recorded her 23 times. Now, she makes fewer mistakes. \n\n“It helps me see what I’m doing wrong so I can fix it,” she said. “It only records when I mess up, so I just try to drive carefully.”\n\nStudies show that devices like this can help teens drive more safely. However, not many families use them. Some parents think they show a lack of trust in their kids.\n\nSince 2007, about 15,000 families in 19 states have used the DriveCam through their insurance company, American Family Insurance. The company says families using the device have seen big improvements, like fewer distractions, less speeding, and safer driving overall.\n\nAnother study in 2009 showed that a similar device called Tiwi also reduced risky driving. It worked best when teens could fix their mistakes before their parents were notified.\n\nRuss Rader, from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, says parents should consider using these devices. “It’s like a parent being in the car with their teen, even when they’re not there,” he said.\n\nStill, some parents prefer to trust their kids without using technology. Mike Gonzalez, whose 17-year-old son just got his license, said, “They need to make their own decisions and learn from them.”\n\nMary Beth Mills, whose 16-year-old son is learning to drive, agreed. “You teach them, and then you trust them to do the right thing,” she said.\n\nBut statistics show teens are the riskiest drivers. Car crashes are the leading cause of death for teenagers in Wisconsin, according to health data.\n\nA survey by State Farm found a gap between what parents think and what teens actually do. About 70% of parents thought their teens followed driving rules, but only 43% of teens said they actually did. These rules, called graduated licensing laws, set curfews and limit passengers for new drivers.\n\nJeff Pierson, a driving instructor in Milwaukee, was surprised when he followed his own teenage son one day. “I thought he was a great driver, but as soon as he had friends in the car, he started driving recklessly,” he said.\n\nWhile teen monitoring devices aren’t very popular, more companies are offering them. Progressive has a device that tracks speed and braking. Another company, 21st Century Auto Insurance, offers a GPS system called MobileTEEN, which lets parents set limits on speed, location, and curfews.\n\nCar makers are also joining in. Ford has a feature called MyKey, which can limit a car’s speed, control radio volume, and block calls and texts. Another product, SeatBeltGuard, alerts parents if teens aren’t wearing seat belts and can also block texting.\n\nA startup company in Wisconsin, TeenGrasshopper, is trying a different approach. Its “How’s My Driving?” decals let other drivers call parents to report unsafe driving.\n\nSome families use smartphone apps to keep track of their teens. For example, the iPhone’s “Find My Friends” app shows a teen’s location. Chris Anderson, from Wisconsin, uses this to check on her 16-year-old son, Grant. \n\n“I trust my child, but it’s good to check in once in a while,” she said."

This raised hopes of a new masterpiece and caused a secret bidding war, with offers reaching tens of millions of euros.\n\nBut Carlo Pedretti, a Leonardo expert from the University of California, said this was not true.  \n\n\"I never said this painting was by Leonardo,\" Pedretti said from his home in Tuscany. \"I only said it needs more study.\"\n\nThe painting, an oil-on-canvas of noblewoman Isabella d’Este, was taken by Swiss authorities. Italian officials are investigating if it was taken out of Italy illegally. Police said on Tuesday that Pedretti had confirmed it was by Leonardo. This claim was also made in a 2013 Italian magazine article, which excited Leonardo fans. \n\nThe painting’s value rose from 95 million euros ($108 million) in 2013 to 120 million euros ($136 million) when police found it in a Swiss bank vault last summer.\n\nPedretti said he saw the painting years ago in Switzerland after the owners' lawyer contacted him. He wrote a letter saying the face in the painting showed promise but suggested more tests should be done before making it public. \n\n\"I didn’t say the work was by Leonardo,\" Pedretti said. \"I just said it was important for studying Leonardo.\"\n\nPedretti believes the painting is old, probably from Leonardo's time. However, some parts, like a palm leaf and wheel, were added later to symbolize St. Catherine. He said he would need to discuss the painting with experts in England, France, and the U.S. before deciding if it is truly by Leonardo.\n\nAlessandro Vezzosi, head of a Leonardo museum in Vinci, said people wrongly claimed Pedretti said the painting was by Leonardo, which raised its price. \n\n“There’s a big difference between tens of thousands and tens of millions of euros,” Vezzosi said.\n\nVezzosi doesn’t believe Leonardo painted the work but said there could be surprises under the surface, like a drawing by Leonardo. \n\nA sketch of Isabella d’Este in the Louvre shows Leonardo knew the subject of the painting. Pedretti does not rule out the idea that Leonardo started the painting but thinks a student probably finished it.\n\n\"Leonardo was busy with his studies in mechanics and physics,\" Pedretti said. \"He didn’t have time to finish paintings.\""

On his final day, he did what many graffiti artists do—he tagged a building near a highway. But he did it with a twist. His name appeared in giant bubble letters made of balloon-like inflatables on a wall near the Long Island Expressway in Queens.\n\nBanksy also showed his other side, as a respected artist, by donating a painting. The painting, which he had bought for $50 at a thrift shop, was sold for $615,000 in an auction. Banksy had altered the original artwork by adding a Nazi soldier to the peaceful landscape. The thrift shop, which helps people struggling with homelessness and AIDS, benefited from the sale.\n\nDuring his time in New York, Banksy posted photos of his work on his website, BanksyNY.com. He gave hints about where to find the art, but never exact locations. Fans turned it into a treasure hunt, using social media to share locations and rushing to see the pieces in person.\n\nBy the end of the month, New Yorkers were split on how they felt about him. Some were annoyed, tweeting things like \"Go home, Banksy!\" Others were impressed and praised his creativity.\n\nA major controversy started when Banksy wrote an essay criticizing the new building replacing the World Trade Center. He called the design boring, saying it looked like something built in Canada, and claimed it showed \"the terrorists won.\" The New York Times refused to publish the essay, so Banksy posted it on his website. His comment upset many, including Brian Major, a 51-year-old New Yorker, who said, \"Enough! Who is this guy? Shut up, Banksy! Go home!\"\n\nNot everyone felt this way. Sean Lynch, a 25-year-old from Staten Island, called Banksy \"one of the most interesting artists of our time.\" He enjoyed visiting Banksy’s works and hearing people from all backgrounds share their thoughts about the art, saying, \"The walls seemed to talk to them.\"\n\nBanksy, whose real name is unknown, started his career spray-painting in Bristol, England. In New York, his art included stencils of figures, spray-painted messages, and even a video of a truck carrying stuffed animals. Some of his works were damaged by other graffiti artists, but his popularity kept growing. One piece was even covered with Plexiglas to protect it. Banksy also sold some of his art on the street for just $60, without telling people it was his work.\n\nRadhika Subramaniam, a professor at Parsons School of Design, says Banksy is part of a long history of graffiti artists, like Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat, whose work was later respected by the art world. She also says Banksy’s work fits into a modern idea of using public spaces to spark conversations about who owns them and what can happen there. However, not everyone loves graffiti. Even Mayor Michael Bloomberg called it \"a sign of decay and loss of control.\"\n\nBut is Banksy’s art actually good? Subramaniam says his work is clever and sometimes sweet, but not always remarkable. She adds that Banksy is no outsider—his ability to market himself and create buzz is part of why people care about his work.\n\nBanksy’s final piece, his name in bubble letters by the road, was described on his website as a tribute to the type of graffiti that New York made famous. Or, he joked, it could just be \"another Banksy piece full of hot air.\""

        "gpt": "In the past, Ebola outbreaks happened in small, rural areas of Central Africa. These places were isolated, so sick people didn’t meet many others. Once the virus had no one else to infect, the outbreaks stopped. But the current outbreak in West Africa is different. It started in areas where several countries meet, with open borders. This allowed the virus to spread quickly and become a global problem.\n\nTo stop this outbreak and prevent it from becoming a permanent issue in West Africa, experts say at least 50% to 70% of Ebola patients need to be isolated. This would stop them from infecting others. These numbers come from studies by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and another group of researchers. If fewer patients are isolated, the outbreak might slow down, but it won’t stop completely and could continue for years.\n\nRight now, each person with Ebola usually infects about two more people. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports over 7,000 cases and more than 3,000 deaths so far. If the outbreak isn’t controlled, the number of deaths could rise to tens of thousands. In the worst-case scenario, the CDC predicts that by January, Sierra Leone and Liberia could have up to 1.4 million cases. However, this can be avoided.\n\nMore help and resources from other countries could reduce the spread of the virus. If we can isolate at least 50% of patients, the outbreak can be controlled. Slowing the spread also gives communities time to build better health centers and work on vaccines. But the longer it takes to act, the greater the risk that areas now free of Ebola could face new cases. Alessandro Vespignani, a scientist studying Ebola, warns that a slow response will lead to more deaths and make the outbreak harder to stop.\n\nEbola’s symptoms usually appear 2 to 21 days after infection. Only then can the disease spread. Some countries, like Senegal and Nigeria, have already stopped the virus. But if the outbreak isn’t fully controlled soon, problems could grow. For example, we don’t know how long people who recover from Ebola stay immune. It’s possible they could get sick again later.\n\nEbola is a dangerous virus, but it doesn’t spread as easily as other diseases. There’s no evidence it is becoming more contagious. For comparison, the 1918 Spanish flu killed over 30 million people worldwide and spread much faster. In past Ebola outbreaks in Central Africa, each sick person infected about 1 to 2 others.

        "gpt": "MINNEAPOLIS — A group of former NHL players is asking for money and better health care because of head injuries they got while playing hockey. They also want to stop the violence in the game, which they believe caused these injuries.\n\nRetired players Dave Christian, Reed Larson, and William Bennett filed a lawsuit on Tuesday. They say the NHL encouraged fighting and didn’t warn players enough about the dangers of head injuries.\n\n“The NHL has a problem with promoting violence,” said Charles “Bucky” Zimmerman, a lawyer helping the players. “If this lawsuit leads to less focus on violence in hockey, that would be a good outcome.”\n\nThis lawsuit is similar to one filed by former NFL players, who sued over head injuries. The hockey players are asking for money and better health checks. Other lawsuits like this have already been filed in Washington and New York.\n\nThe NHL says it is not surprised by this lawsuit. NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly said, “We expected more lawsuits like this. We still believe they have no merit, and we will fight them.”\n\nThe NHL Players’ Association (NHLPA) declined to comment.\n\nZimmerman also worked on the NFL case, which ended with the NFL agreeing to pay $765 million to former players. That case inspired hockey players to take legal action too.\n\n“We’ve seen this in football, and now it’s happening in hockey,” Zimmerman said. “We believe the NHL knew about the dangers of head injuries but didn’t act fast enough to protect players. Even now, fighting is still allowed, and players are still at risk.”\n\nThe lawsuit claims the NHL didn’t tell players about the full risks of concussions. As a result, players are more likely to suffer memory loss, depression, and brain diseases like dementia, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s.\n\nSome argue that hockey players know the risks when they fight. Zimmerman disagrees. “Fighting wouldn’t happen if the NHL didn’t allow it,” he said. “The league makes the rules, not the players. If fighting was banned, players wouldn’t fight.”\n\nZimmerman believes more players will join this lawsuit, just like the NFL case grew over time.\n\n“As more football players shared their stories, hockey players realized they could speak out too,” Zimmerman said. “We’ve always known players get hurt, but now we’re finally talking about it and trying to make changes.”"

        "gpt": "WASHINGTON — The International Space Station (ISS), the world’s most expensive science project, will likely stay in space for four more years, until 2024. This decision, approved by the White House, could cost NASA about $3 billion a year from 2021 to 2024. NASA officials pushed for this extension because they see the station as an important step toward future space exploration.\n\nHowever, the extension still needs approval from Congress and future presidents. President Obama’s support now might make it harder for the next president to cancel this plan. NASA’s announcement is also expected to reassure its international partners, who have been wondering how long the U.S. will keep supporting the station.\n\nThe decision may also send a message to China, which is planning to build its own space station in the future. By keeping the ISS running, NASA can show its strength in space technology and limit China’s chances to partner with other countries for their program.\n\nNASA has faced challenges in recent years. Since retiring the space shuttle in 2011, the U.S. has relied on Russia to take astronauts to the ISS, paying $1.7 billion for this service through 2017. NASA hopes private companies, like SpaceX, will soon take over this job with new spacecraft, but these won’t be ready before 2017. Extending the ISS’s life until 2024 gives these U.S. companies time to handle NASA missions and grow their businesses.\n\nNASA says the ISS is strong enough to stay operational until at least 2028, despite occasional problems like a cooling system issue that astronauts fixed recently. Extending its mission also allows NASA and its partners to make the most of their investment. In the station’s early years, little research was done. Now, the six-person crew spends 50 hours a week on science, compared to just three hours weekly in 2008.\n\nThe ISS is being used for many studies, including observing Earth, studying cosmic rays, and learning how space affects astronaut health. This research is especially important for future missions to Mars, which could take years and expose astronauts to dangers like radiation. \n\nAstronauts have been living and working on the station since 2000, usually for six months at a time. Over the years, they’ve helped NASA study problems like bone loss and muscle weakening caused by space travel. However, some mysteries remain, such as why some astronauts have vision problems after long stays in space. Former astronaut Leroy Chiao, who commanded the ISS in 2004 and 2005, said the extra four years could help answer these questions and solve other scientific challenges.\n\nChiao called the extension an important step for NASA and space exploration."

        "gpt": "LOS ANGELES — Last week, leaders in the small town of Willits, California, checked their water supply. They found out their two reservoirs only had enough water to last 100 days. They decided they needed to take serious action.\n\nWillits, a town of 5,000 people in Mendocino County, is now saving water in every way possible. Families of four should not use more than 150 gallons of water each day. People can’t water their gardens, wash cars, or clean driveways with hoses. Businesses must cut their water use by 35 percent.\n\n\"The more we looked at the numbers, the more we saw how bad the situation is,\" said Adrienne Moore, the city manager of Willits.\n\nCalifornia has had very little rain this winter, following a dry year in 2013. Many are worried the state might face a drought like the one in the late 1980s or, even worse, in 1977. There’s still some time left in the rainy season, but if the sunny weather continues, many areas will run out of water.\n\nSmall towns like Willits are at risk because they don’t have extra water saved from past years, said Maury Roos, a state water expert. But places like Southern California and San Francisco have enough water stored to last through this year and even into 2015 without needing to ration. Farmers in some areas, like those who grow lettuce in Imperial County, will also get their usual water supply. However, other farmers and ranchers, especially those in the San Joaquin Valley, are already struggling.\n\nCarre Brown, a Mendocino County leader, said, \"I’m scared to think about what will happen if it doesn’t rain. Our reservoirs are very low.\"\n\nWillits is looking for state help to pay for new water sources. The town might spend $850,000 to use well water or drill new wells. They may also use water from a nearby lake. Even before the strict water rules started, many people in Willits had already begun saving water. \"People here are good at conserving,\" Moore said.\n\nBut there’s one group that might cause trouble: marijuana growers. \"They use a lot of water,\" Moore explained. If they don’t cut back, the town will send officers to make sure they follow the rules.\n\nLast year was California’s driest year in over 100 years, and on Friday, Governor Jerry Brown declared a drought emergency. This allows the state to help local governments faster and make it easier to share water between areas.\n\nEven though 2013 was very dry, it wasn’t the worst year on record. But water levels in most reservoirs are much lower than usual. Some, like Shasta and Lake Oroville, had even less water in past years like 2009 and 1991. There’s still a chance for rain. In 2009 and 1991, big storms came late in the season and saved the water supply.\n\nOne of the worst examples this year is Folsom Lake, near Sacramento. It is only 18 percent full, which is close to a record low. This has worried people in the area, where water use is very high. In Sacramento suburbs, people use about 369 gallons of water per day, three times more than Los Angeles. Local officials have asked people to stop outdoor watering, and this may soon become a rule.\n\nSacramento, the state’s capital, has also started rationing water. \"We’re not going to use extreme measures, but we’re asking everyone to use 20 percent less water,\" said city manager John Shirey. Many homes in Sacramento still don’t have water meters, so people pay a flat rate and can use as much water as they want. However, water use has been dropping, and dry years like this one are teaching people to save water all the time.\n\nShirey said, \"With climate change happening, we need to prepare for long-term water shortages. Everyone needs to change how they think about water — we’ll have less of it.\"\n\nFor now, California’s Catholic bishops are asking people to pray for rain."

        "gpt": "LOS ANGELES — The song \"The Monster\" by Eminem played loudly in a hallway at Sylmar Juvenile Hall.  \n\n_I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed_  \n_Get along with the voices inside of my head_  \n_You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath_  \n_And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy_  \n\nTen teenagers sat around a table near the guard station. Some were waiting for trials for serious crimes like murder or robbery. They closed their eyes and nodded to the music.  \n\nIn the middle of the group sat Scott Budnick. He looked young, wearing a hoodie and sneakers. He asked the teens to write about the lyrics that stood out to them. One line caught his attention:  \n\n_\"Save me from myself and all this conflict / 'Cause the very thing that I love's killing me and I can't conquer it.\"_  \n\nMagic, a 17-year-old from Compton, smiled and said he had underlined that line.  \n\n\"I want to rap and be an artist when I get out,\" he said.  \n\nScott Budnick's life is very different from the teens'. He used to be a Hollywood executive, working on movies like \"The Hangover.\" He spent years climbing the ladder, doing small jobs like fetching coffee, and eventually had a fancy office. But it didn’t make him happy.  \n\n\"You can only talk about actors and directors for so long before it gets boring,\" Budnick said.  \n\nIn 2003, a friend introduced him to InsideOut Writers, a program where volunteers teach writing in juvenile halls. Budnick attended a class and was deeply moved by the teens and their stories.  \n\nHe grew up in a wealthy area of Atlanta where fights never involved weapons or arrests. Seeing these young men, many of whom had rough childhoods, changed him.  \n\n\"Talking to these kids gives me purpose,\" he said.  \n\nIn the small classroom at Barry J. Nidorf Juvenile Hall, the teens, mostly Black and Latino, talked about the song \"The Monster.\" Then, Budnick brought up a news story about a man named Steven Czifra, who spent eight years in solitary confinement but later went to college.  \n\nThe teens wrote poems inspired by Czifra's words: \"I have a gift.\"  \n\nA teen named Andres, who dreams of being an architect, read his poem:  \n\"My life is a gift but also a curse / My life has a lot of truths and a lot of lies / I like this gift but I don't because sometimes I see no light / I know my life is a gift but also a curse.\"  \n\nBudnick tries to give the teens hope. He told them that laws about juvenile sentencing have become a little fairer in recent years.  \n\n\"Good things are happening,\" he said. \"No matter what, we’ll always be here for you.\"  \n\nSome teens didn’t trust Budnick at first.  \n\n\"I thought he’d be a show-off Hollywood guy,\" said Antonio, a 16-year-old. \"But he’s really humble.\"  \n\nAntonio said the writing class helps him deal with stress. \"Instead of fighting, I write about it,\" he said.  \n\nBudnick also started a garden project at the juvenile hall. The teens planted vegetables and herbs in containers outside their dorms. The area was surrounded by barbed wire, and the only grass was far away.  \n\nBudnick believes caring for plants helps the teens learn empathy. \"Most of them weren’t cared for when they were younger,\" he said. \"That’s why they’re here.\"  \n\nThe teens laughed and joked with Budnick as they worked. When he mentioned buying citrus trees for the garden, one boy shouted, \"Bail me out!\"  \n\nBudnick replied, \"With your bail, I’d have to win big!\"  \n\nBudnick doesn’t just help in juvenile halls. He also works to change laws for young offenders. He takes former inmates to Sacramento to speak with lawmakers. In 2012, they helped pass a law allowing parole reviews for people sentenced to life as teens.  \n\nIn 2013, Budnick started the Anti-Recidivism Coalition, a nonprofit that helps former inmates with things like college applications and support groups. This fall, 24 former inmates will live in dorms while attending L.A. Mission College, thanks to a special program.  \n\nBudnick’s efforts have earned him awards, including being named California’s Volunteer of the Year in 2012. The White House also recognized him as a \"champion of change.\"  \n\nEven after all this, Budnick keeps in touch with the teens he’s met. He visits about 10 prisons each year to see them. While filming \"The Hangover 3,\" he even brought actors Zach Galifianakis and Ed Helms to visit a former student in solitary confinement.  \n\nLast year, Budnick left his Hollywood job to start a new company focused on social justice.  \n\n\"I want to tell stories that can make a difference,\" he said."

        "gpt": "In 2009, Tim Chartier, a math professor at Davidson College, and his students created a way to predict winners in the NCAA men's basketball tournament. Their method used simple math, like middle school algebra, and looked at things like how tough teams' schedules were and how well they played at the end of the season. That year, their picks were better than 97% of the 4 million people who joined ESPN's March Madness contest.\n\n\"I was shocked, especially since it was new research,\" Chartier said from his office in North Carolina.\n\nThe next year, and the years after that, his students did it again. It was a fun project, part of the yearly excitement of March Madness, where people try to guess the winners of all 63 games in the tournament. This year's tournament starts Thursday and ends in April with the Final Four in Texas.\n\nBut things got more interesting in January. Quicken Loans, with support from billionaire Warren Buffett, announced they would give $1 billion to anyone who could pick every game correctly.\n\n\"When I heard about it, I told my wife, 'This is going to get complicated for me this year,'\" Chartier said.\n\nHe was right. Since the announcement, Chartier and other math experts have been in the spotlight. They've been on TV and in the news, explaining the odds and helping people try to win Buffett's challenge.\n\nRecently, Chartier and his students held a seminar in New York City. About 45 basketball fans paid up to $100 to learn from them, and 20 reporters came to watch. Chartier is also part of a team for *The New York Times* to make a winning bracket. The other team members? Four young girls who star in the Broadway show *Matilda the Musical.*\n\nEven Chartier's 11-year-old son, Noah, got excited. He asked his dad to help him make his own bracket. \"Daddy, it's a billion dollars,\" Noah said. Chartier replied, \"How about this? I’ll help you, but if we win, you get $25 million a year for 40 years, and I get $1 million a year.\" After thinking about it, Noah agreed.\n\nBut even with help from his dad, Noah probably won’t win. Jeffrey Bergen, a math professor at DePaul University, calculated the odds of making a perfect bracket: 1 in 9 quintillion (that’s a 9 followed by 18 zeroes!). \n\nBergen says the odds are a little better if you know something about basketball. In that case, your chances are about 1 in 128 billion. Still, it’s extremely hard.\n\n\"If someone has a perfect bracket after the first round, their chances of getting the rest right are still only 1 in 7.5 million,\" Bergen said. \"The later games are harder because the teams are more evenly matched. It’s like flipping a coin 31 times in a row and guessing right every time.\"\n\nIf someone makes it through two rounds, their odds of finishing perfectly improve to 1 in 32,000. \"That’s better than winning the lottery, but it’s still really tough,\" Bergen said. \"Try flipping a coin 15 times in a row and getting it right every time. It’ll take a while!\"\n\nThis shows that the billion-dollar challenge is more of a publicity stunt. \"Buffett and his team know how impossible this is,\" Bergen said.\n\nJohn Diver, who runs ESPN’s online bracket contest, agrees. He said that in 17 years, no one has ever made a perfect bracket. \"Only once in the last seven years has someone even gotten the first 32 games right,\" Diver said. \"That’s out of about 40 million brackets. It’s basically impossible.\"\n\nDiver predicts that after the first day or two of games, no one will have a perfect bracket. \"By Friday afternoon, there won’t be any perfect brackets left,\" he said. \"If we don’t have one, Buffett’s contest won’t either. But I kind of hope someone gets close, just to make Buffett nervous.\"\n\nESPN’s contest offers a smaller prize: a $10,000 Best Buy gift card. Other contests have similar prizes. Diver joked that ESPN should offer something even bigger than Buffett’s prize. \"Let’s offer $1 trillion,\" he said. \"Let’s beat Buffett at his own game!\""

        "gpt": "**A New Beginning for A.J. Briscoe**\n\nOn Monday, September 29, A.J. Briscoe woke up to heavy rain in Minneapolis. His van had broken down the day before, so he had to cancel a meeting at his favorite coffee shop. Instead, he worked from his dining table, thinking about how weather and car troubles were the biggest problems on this special day.\n\n**Freedom After 22 Years**\n\nFor the first time in 22 years, Briscoe was free from any kind of state supervision. Since he was 14, he had been under strict rules—reporting his actions, dealing with surprise visits, and living only where he was allowed. Now, he can vote, travel, and work toward his dream of becoming a business owner and literacy advocate for young people.\n\nBut freedom is both exciting and overwhelming. Briscoe, now married with a 5-year-old son, admits it's hard to stay positive sometimes. He is working to rebuild his relationship with his son while trying to leave his troubled past behind.\n\n\"It's like washing a car,\" he said. \"The dirt doesn't come off easily.\"\n\n**A Difficult Past**\n\nBriscoe grew up in Tennessee and later moved to Minneapolis with his mother, Debra Haynes, to be closer to his grandmother. His grandparents were good role models, but Briscoe was drawn to the streets. Though he was smart and got invited to top schools, he thought it wasn’t \"cool\" to be a good student. His father was involved in crime, and his mother struggled to raise him and his sister with little money.\n\nAt 12, Briscoe was arrested for carrying drugs. By 14, he had made $200,000 from selling drugs like cocaine, weed, and pills. He convinced himself he wasn’t hurting anyone because he wasn’t stealing or breaking into homes. But his life became a cycle of arrests, prison time, and parole.\n\nHis grandmother never gave up on him. She wrote letters and encouraged him to use his potential. Her belief in him stayed with Briscoe, even after she passed away in 2012.\n\n**A Turning Point**\n\nBriscoe’s transformation started years ago in prison. One day, he heard a cellmate struggling to read a children’s book to his child. Briscoe realized how important reading was. Even though he had a GED, he wanted to be able to help his own future child with homework one day.\n\nPrison became his classroom. He started reading everything he could, from law books to inspirational stories by black leaders. He even found a mistake in a legal case against him, which reduced his sentence from 60 years to three.\n\n\"Reading saved my life,\" he said.\n\n**Helping Others Read**\n\nWhile in prison, Briscoe started a program called BRAINS to improve the prison library. Now free, he focuses on helping kids like his younger self. He wrote a book called *Changing Places* and started a literacy program called *To Succeed You Must Read!* The program includes school visits, a summer book club, and even a block party to celebrate reading.\n\nBriscoe wants to inspire kids to make better choices. Recently, he spoke with a 21-year-old gang leader who felt trapped in his lifestyle. Briscoe and another mentor helped the young man see a different future, encouraging him to focus on music instead of violence.\n\n\"We may have saved a life,\" Briscoe said.\n\n**Family and Community**\n\nBriscoe’s wife, Sundia, is his biggest supporter. They live in a home filled with African art and a porch with free books for kids. Every day, children come by to grab books and enjoy Briscoe’s cooking.\n\nSundia and Briscoe’s son’s mother, Yarmisha, are helping him become a better father. Briscoe spends time with his son, Zah’Neire, playing at the park and doing puzzles together. He admits he is still learning how to be a dad.\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nBriscoe is now focused on his future. He recently hosted a spelling bee and is earning money from his books and motivational talks. He also visits daycare centers to read to children and plans to host workshops for men in October.\n\nStill, staying on the right path isn’t easy. Some people from his past expect him to return to his old ways. But Briscoe is determined to succeed honestly.\n\n\"I just think about how far I’ve come,\" he said."

        "gpt": "BERLIN — This is the story of a famous German children's book artist who, during World War II, saved hundreds of Jews from the Nazis.\n\nBefore Werner Klemke became loved for his drawings in \"Grimm's Fairy Tales\" and fun magazine covers, he was a soldier in Nazi Germany. He later built a career in East Germany, even though the government there was strict and controlling. But this story, which he never told anyone, is about what he did during the war. It only came to light when a filmmaker, Annet Betsalel, found records in the archives of a Jewish community in the Netherlands.\n\nIn 1942, a Jewish businessman named Sam van Perlstein realized Jews would not survive under Nazi rule without help. He set up a secret network to fight back and help people hide. This story is now a documentary called *Rendezvous at Erasmus*.\n\nIt all started in Amsterdam, in a bookstore called Erasmus. The store sold books the Nazis didn’t like. One day, a young German soldier named Johannes Gerhardt visited the store. He loved books and even forgot his rifle when he left. A young man, Mels de Jong, returned it to him, and they became friends. De Jong was married to van Perlstein’s daughter.\n\nVan Perlstein needed fake documents to show he was part Aryan so he could reclaim his business and money. He asked Gerhardt for help. Gerhardt was a photographer and knew a friend who could make the documents: Werner Klemke. Klemke was an artist, loved books, and hated the Nazis.\n\nThe fake documents fooled everyone. Van Perlstein used the money from his business to fund the resistance and help hide Jews. Klemke created a cover story to avoid suspicion. He told his Nazi bosses he wanted to make booklets of cocktail recipes and needed a small graphics office. They agreed, and while he made the booklets, he also secretly created fake birth certificates, ID cards, and food ration coupons.\n\nKlemke knew he could be killed if caught, but he kept going. His work helped many Jews escape or survive in hiding. In the villages where his documents were used, more than 50% of Jews survived, compared to less than 20% in the rest of the Netherlands.\n\nJohannes Gerhardt wasn’t as lucky. He was killed in 1944 during the war. But the network they built saved around 500 Jews, as well as resistance fighters and British pilots.\n\nKlemke never talked about what he did. Even when he was interviewed later in life, he didn’t mention it. On his deathbed, he told his children about letters from Jews he had saved. These letters were proof of what he had done, in case anyone accused him of being a Nazi.\n\nWhen asked about his actions, he once said, \"I only did what any man should have done.\" He and van Perlstein often reminded each other that they had saved too few people, and so many others were lost.\n\nAfter the war, Klemke became famous for his illustrations. He drew for children’s books, like *Grimm’s Fairy Tales*, and created fun, colorful art even in the strict, gray world of East Germany. He also illustrated serious works like *The Iliad* and *The Decameron*. His art brought joy, humor, and beauty to people’s lives.\n\nKlemke believed his work mattered. Before he died in 1994, he spoke about why he illustrated children’s books. He said he imagined children, alone because their parents were busy, looking at the pictures and understanding the stories. Through his art, he brought light and hope to a difficult world."

        "gpt": "WASHINGTON — Russia has announced new bans on U.S. and European farm products, including chicken and turkey. These bans are small compared to the bigger trade issues between Russia, the U.S., and Europe. However, they are still significant for poultry producers in the southern U.S., from the Carolinas to Texas.\n\nRussia’s ban affects over $1 billion in U.S. farm exports each year, but it’s less severe than the sanctions placed on Russian energy and financial companies by the U.S. and Europe. Still, the ban impacts certain products like salmon eggs from Washington state and nuts from California. It’s especially tough on poultry producers in the Carolinas, Mississippi, and Texas.\n\nMike Cockrell, the financial officer of Sanderson Farms, a large poultry company, said Russia used to be a bigger market for U.S. chicken. In 2008, Russia bought 20% of U.S. poultry exports. Last year, Sanderson Farms sent 87.5 million pounds of chicken to Russia, worth $40 million. While this is a lot of money, it’s only about 1.5% of the company’s total sales. Cockrell said the company will look for new places to sell its chicken.\n\nPilgrim’s Pride, another big poultry company, operates in many southern states and ships to 105 countries. It did not comment on how the ban will affect it. Tyson Foods, another major exporter, said 3% of its chicken exports and 9% of its pork exports went to Russia in 2012. Tyson said losing the Russian market is disappointing but not a big problem because they can sell to other countries.\n\nWhen the U.S. and Europe placed stronger sanctions on Russia last month, many expected Russia to respond. Sanderson Farms had already started looking for new buyers for its dark chicken and turkey meat. Cockrell admitted it will take time to replace the Russian market but said the company is doing well at finding new buyers.\n\nMost of Sanderson Farms’ exports come from plants in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, though some come from North Carolina. The company is also planning to build a new plant in North Carolina that will focus on exports. Much of its chicken is shipped through the Port of New Orleans.\n\nSouth Carolina and Georgia ports also ship food to Russia. Last year, about 3% of exports from South Carolina ports went to Russia, mainly food products like chicken and peanuts. Curtis Foltz, head of the Georgia Ports Authority, said Georgia is closely watching the trade ban and looking for other markets.\n\nRussia has banned U.S. poultry before, including in 2003, 2004, and briefly in 2010. These bans hurt U.S. companies but also make chicken more expensive for Russian consumers since Russia has to import chicken feed. Cockrell said, “We don’t sell chicken to Putin. We sell chicken to Russian consumers, and they are the ones who will suffer.”\n\nThe U.S. has avoided sanctions that would harm ordinary Russians, but Russia’s ban limits its own people’s access to food. David Cohen, a U.S. Treasury official, said Russia’s actions are like punishing its own citizens. \n\nBecause of Russia’s unpredictable bans, some U.S. poultry companies, like Case Farms in North Carolina, have already stopped selling to Russia. Mitch Mitchell of Case Farms said the Russian market was too unreliable. Instead, the company exports to countries like South Korea and China. However, if Russia stays closed to U.S. chicken for a long time, it could lead to lower profits as companies compete for the same buyers in other countries."

        "gpt": "BERLIN — England wants Winnie-the-Pooh back.\n\nNot just any Pooh, though. They want the original stuffed bear — the one before the books, movies, and all the toys. This is the real bear that belonged to Christopher Robin Milne, son of A.A. Milne, the author of the Pooh stories.\n\nThis bear used to bump down the stairs behind Christopher Robin as he got ready to hear stories about Pooh. Later, these stories became the book *The House at Pooh Corner*. In 1947, Christopher Robin gave the bear to the American publisher of the books, saying he had grown up and moved on from childhood.\n\nThe bear stayed in the publisher's office until 1987, when it was donated to the New York Public Library. Today, the bear is displayed at the library, but some British people feel it doesn’t belong there. They say the bear should come home to England, where it all began.\n\nThe *Times* of London wrote that Winnie-the-Pooh isn’t just a toy. He’s a symbol of English childhood, representing a magical place where stuffed animals have gentle adventures. They also argued that Pooh is not American and shouldn’t stay in New York.\n\nThis isn’t a new demand. Even former British Prime Minister Tony Blair reportedly talked about it with U.S. President Bill Clinton. The *Times* suggested building a special museum for Pooh in East Sussex, near the real Hundred Acre Wood, where Christopher Robin and his stuffed friends had their adventures.\n\nThe *Times* also said Pooh wasn’t sold to America and that British people weren’t asked before the bear was taken across the ocean. They called this a \"plundered piece of history.\" However, the New York Public Library says Pooh is well cared for and too fragile to travel. Angela Montefinise, a library spokesperson, explained that the toys live in the Children’s Center of the library, alongside other treasures like Shakespeare’s First Folios and a Gutenberg Bible. Pooh, she said, is loved by visitors and librarians alike, who even leave him honey and a red balloon on his birthday.\n\nSome British people, like writer Gyles Brandreth, would love to see Pooh return to England. However, he also recalled that Christopher Robin himself was happy for the toys to stay in New York. Once his childhood ended, he was okay with letting them go.\n\nDespite this, the *Times* insists that Pooh belongs in England. They compared it to how Americans would feel if the original *Moby Dick* were displayed in another country. For the English, having Pooh back would feel as sweet as a jar of honey."

Police officers, likely planning security for the visit, stood in the courtyard of one of the tall brick buildings.\n\nOn one end of the block, the sidewalk was messy from dogs whose owners hadn’t cleaned up. This area is very different from the beauty of St. Patrick’s Cathedral or the quiet respect of the 9/11 Memorial. It’s also a sharp contrast to the green spaces of Central Park.\n\nThe pope will visit those famous places too, but he chose to come to this Harlem school on September 25 because its students—mostly immigrants and kids from poor families—are the people he believes need the most help. The school is in a mostly Black and Latino neighborhood, a fitting choice for a pope who speaks often about poverty, immigration, and the problems of greed.\n\nThis part of Harlem hasn’t changed much, unlike other parts that have been transformed by gentrification—where wealthier people move in, often pushing out longtime residents.\n\n“That’s why I like this neighborhood. It’s not like the new Harlem,” said Sherwin Robinson, who moved to the block about a year and a half ago. He lives in a brick building right across from the school and will have a great view of the pope’s visit.\n\nOur Lady Queen of Angels is one of six Catholic elementary schools in Harlem and the South Bronx managed by the New York Archdiocese. Catholic schools, which Pope Francis sees as important for helping the poor, are facing tough times. Since 2011, New York has lost over 50 Catholic schools due to changing populations, competition from free charter schools, and other reasons.\n\n“I hope this changes how people think about urban Catholic schools in America,” said Kathleen Porter-Magee, who helps run the school and five others. “For years, people have been pessimistic about these schools, but I think we’re now realizing how important they are. I believe the pope’s visit will bring attention to them.”\n\nThe school has 290 students, from prekindergarten to eighth grade. Most come from families with low incomes and need financial aid.\n\nAcross the street, at the Vianel Beauty Salon, women working on customers’ hair are also hoping the visit will highlight the loss of Our Lady Queen of Angels Church. The church, which was next to the school, closed in 2007. Many other churches in the area have also shut down due to fewer members and other issues.\n\nLili Garcia, 71, got married in the church 54 years ago. She misses both the church and her husband, who passed away last year. Holding an old wedding photo, she wept as she spoke about the pope coming to the neighborhood.\n\nWhile at the school, Pope Francis will meet a few students chosen by lottery. He will also meet refugees and immigrants, including children who came to the U.S. alone.\n\nGarcia and her friends at the salon have been preparing for the visit for weeks. She has a folder full of newspaper articles about Pope Francis, written in her native Spanish. She plans to display them in the salon’s windows. \n\nVianel Garcia, who runs the salon, and her mother, Amparo Duarte, are also planning decorations. They’ll put up balloons and host a party for people hoping to see the pope. “I get goosebumps just thinking about it,” Duarte said, showing her arms as she served homemade empanadas.\n\nNot everyone on the block is excited. Danny Sheeri, who works at a plumbing store nearby, shrugged off the visit. “I’m worried about business. Why do I care about the pope?” he said, smoking a cigarette.\n\nBut for Lili Garcia, the visit feels like a blessing for the neighborhood. “We finally have a pope who understands the people,” she said, looking out the salon window at the school. She praised Pope Francis for being humble and helping the church adapt to modern times. \n\n“It’s a big blessing to have the pope here,” Garcia said. “We know things will change. We can feel it.”\n\nThe night before the pope arrives, Duarte’s apartment will be full of friends and family staying over. They want to avoid being blocked by security when the street closes. Their dream is to catch the pope’s eye, maybe get a blessing or a hug—or even invite him over for some chicken and rice."

        "gpt": "MOUNT IDA, Ark. — The world of plants might become a mystery in the future. Fewer college students are studying plants (botany), and U.S. universities are closing their collections of preserved plants, called herbaria.\n\nSince 1988, the number of universities offering botany degrees has dropped by half. In 2012, fewer than 400 students earned botany degrees in the U.S. Experts say this is because students are being encouraged to choose technology-focused fields instead.\n\nBotanists are worried. Without enough plant experts, it will be harder to teach about plants, protect nature, find new medicines, or develop alternative fuels. At the same time, universities and states are cutting costs and closing herbaria, which are expensive to keep. Herbaria store plant samples that botanists use for research.\n\n\"We won't understand what we have in the world,\" said Joe Miller, a scientist at the National Science Foundation. He said only 20% of the world’s plant and animal species have been identified so far.\n\nIn Arkansas, a group of researchers looked for a rare plant called the Missouri bladderpod. This yellow-flowered plant only grows in 75 places worldwide, most near cities where they are at risk. Theo Witsell, a botanist with the Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission, joined the search. He carried a small shovel and plastic bags to collect samples. \n\n\"There aren’t many jobs in botany,\" Witsell said. \"But as older botanists retire, there will be fewer people qualified to take their place.\" Witsell works to protect areas where new plant species are still being discovered.\n\nBotanists like Witsell are important, Miller said. \"If we can name a plant, we can study how it works,\" Miller explained. \"And if we know how it works, we can figure out how to use it.\" For example, quinine, a medicine for malaria, comes from cinchona trees. By studying similar plants, scientists can find new medicines.\n\nHerbaria are important for plant research, but many are being shut down. States and universities, including the University of Iowa and the University of Nebraska, have already closed their collections. Herbaria need special care, like temperature and humidity control, which can be costly.\n\nThe University of Missouri recently gave its 200,000 plant samples to the Missouri Botanical Garden. The university said the building that housed the collection was too old and expensive to fix.\n\nIn Arkansas, Witsell is working to save plant collections. After the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville almost closed its herbarium in 2003, and the University of Arkansas at Little Rock later shut its collection, Witsell decided to act. Over 12 years, he and a small team collected and preserved over 70,000 plant species for the Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission. Their herbarium is now the most active in the state.\n\n\"This is the physical record of plant life in Arkansas and on Earth,\" Witsell said. \"A photo can’t tell you everything.\""

        "gpt": "CHICAGO — In the busy streets of Chicago's Magnificent Mile, among the tall buildings and tourists, there are homeless people holding signs asking for help.\n\nMany of these signs look quickly made, but recently some have been changed. A Chicago art student, Ian Todd, started a project to create new, beautifully written signs for the homeless. He hoped these signs would stand out in the busy streets and make people more likely to stop and help.\n\nIan, 23, moved to Chicago from California to study advertising and design. He was surprised by how many homeless people he saw. While taking a class on creative lettering, he thought that a well-designed sign might grab more attention.\n\nIn April, Ian began asking homeless people if they wanted new signs. Some said no, but others agreed. Over two months, he made about 20 signs. Each sign took 5 to 10 hours to complete because of the detailed lettering. Ian also started a blog called \"The Urban Type Experiment\" to share his experience, and it quickly became popular online.\n\nThe signs tell different stories. One talks about a single father trying to support his kids. Another shares a woman’s wish to work so she can afford a bus ticket home. Ian stayed in touch with many people who received the signs. While some signs helped people get more donations, others didn’t make much difference.\n\nOne man, Mike Droney, 54, has been homeless for six years. He lost his leg while serving in Somalia and now sits outside a Starbucks asking for help. His sign, made by Ian, says: \"I lost my leg for my country. Please help, you will be blessed.\" Mike says people often compliment the sign, but he isn’t sure if it has helped him get more money.\n\nAnother man, Ulysses White, 54, says his sign has made a big difference. Ulysses, who served in Iraq, was introduced to Ian by a friend. His sign mentions his military service and says, \"Anything is appreciated. Thank you for your generosity.\" Ulysses believes the sign has helped him a lot.\n\nIan’s project isn’t the first of its kind. In 2011, Christopher Devine, another Chicago resident, printed simple signs for the homeless using bold letters. While Devine’s signs were plain, Ian’s are more artistic. Both projects aimed to bring attention to homelessness, and Devine said he was glad to see Ian’s work.\n\nNot everyone agrees with these projects. Some people think the signs could be offensive to the homeless. But Devine said the important thing is that people are now talking about homelessness.\n\nEd Shurna, from the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless, says that while the new signs might help some individuals, the bigger problem of homelessness needs larger solutions. He says the homeless population in Chicago is growing, with 6,000 people staying in shelters every night. He warns that state budget cuts could make things worse, leading to more shelters closing and more people living on the streets.\n\nIan graduated from his design school in May and recently moved to Los Angeles for a new job. He told his homeless friends in Chicago that he wouldn’t be able to make more signs for them but hasn’t ruled out starting a similar project in California.\n\n\"Homelessness is everywhere,\" Ian said. \"I wouldn’t mind doing this again.\""

He shot Walter Scott, an unarmed black man, during a traffic stop three days earlier.\n\nSlager, 33, first claimed Scott had taken his Taser during a struggle on Saturday morning. But a video, shared on Tuesday, showed Scott, 50, running unarmed. In the footage, Slager is seen shooting at Scott's back multiple times. A report said Scott was hit several times.\n\nPolice Chief Eddie Driggers said he was \"sickened\" by the video.\n\nThe news conference on Wednesday became tense as protesters interrupted, chanting \"No justice! No peace!\" They demanded answers about the investigation. The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) is leading the investigation, with help from the FBI.\n\nMayor Summey and Chief Driggers said they could not answer specific questions because SLED is in charge. Summey admitted he had not seen the whole video. The video was recorded by a bystander and given to Scott’s family.\n\nThe mayor and chief visited Scott's family earlier that day. They promised to provide a police escort for Scott’s funeral. Summey called the family \"kind and down-to-earth\" and said, \"We do not support wrongdoing, no matter who it is.\"\n\nDriggers added, \"I am praying for peace for the family and the community.\"\n\nSlager was arrested on Tuesday and is in jail. He has been fired from the police force. Summey said Slager’s wife, who is eight months pregnant, will stay on the city’s health insurance until after her baby is born. \"We think that’s the right thing to do,\" he said.\n\nNew body cameras were ordered on Wednesday to add to the 115 cameras the city already has through a federal grant. However, Summey said it will take time to train officers and create rules for using the cameras.\n\nScott's family said they were happy about the arrest. Their attorney said they felt \"relieved\" that charges were filed.\n\n\"All we wanted was the truth, and now we have it,\" said Walter’s brother, Anthony Scott. \"Not all police officers are bad, but there are some bad ones.\"\n\nThis was the 11th police shooting in South Carolina this year, according to Thom Berry from SLED. Berry said the investigation is ongoing and did not share details about how the video was obtained.\n\nProtesters gathered outside the North Charleston city building on Wednesday. They held signs and chanted.\n\n\"We’re here for justice because black lives matter,\" said Jeremy Johnson, a 21-year-old resident. He said he was upset but not surprised by the video.\n\n\"This isn’t just about Charleston. It’s about Mike Brown, Eric Garner, and everyone else,\" he said.\n\nProtesters said the shooting shows bigger problems in policing. They called for peaceful demonstrations.\n\n\"The system is the problem, not individual officers,\" said Pastor Thomas Ravenell. \"We can’t change the law by breaking it.\"\n\nFormer Governor Mark Sanford, now a U.S. congressman, visited the protest and spoke with local ministers. He called the shooting \"unbelievable.\" Sanford said it was too early to talk about changes like body cameras or police reforms but praised officials for quickly charging the officer.\n\n\"As the mayor said, right is right and wrong is wrong,\" Sanford said. \"We all face the consequences of our decisions, and so will this officer.\""

        "gpt": "PYRAMID LAKE, Nev. — Brian Dunn spent hours casting his fishing line into the clear blue waters of Pyramid Lake, a desert lake north of Reno. After lunch, he finally caught something special: a 6-pound, 25-inch-long cutthroat trout. But this wasn’t just any fish—it had a yellow tag near its fin, marking it as a Pyramid Lake Lahontan cutthroat trout, a species once thought to be extinct.\n\n\"It's amazing to bring a species back from extinction,\" said Dunn, a fisherman from Truckee. \"It’s rare, but it’s worth it.\"\n\nThis is a story of a fish that survived against all odds. It’s about saving a species that once swam in Pyramid Lake thousands of years ago when the lake was part of a much larger body of water called Lake Lahontan. The Lahontan cutthroat trout, with its pink stripes and orange-red cheeks, is the largest inland trout in North America, growing as big as salmon.\n\nFor years, these fish were thought to be gone. But thanks to scientists and dedicated fish experts, they are making a big comeback. In 2006, the fish were reintroduced to Pyramid Lake, and now some weigh over 20 pounds. People are even wondering if a new world record could happen soon. The current record is a 41-pound trout caught in 1925.\n\n\"It's exciting to see them return,\" said Dave Hamel, a fisherman from Reno who caught and released a 21-pound trout this year.\n\nAnother group of these trout was released into Fallen Leaf Lake near Lake Tahoe in 2002. Last year, for the first time in over 70 years, the fish spawned (laid eggs) in a nearby stream.\n\n\"This is such an exciting story,\" said Mary Peacock, a biology professor at the University of Nevada, Reno. \"We thought these fish were gone forever. Now, people are imagining them again.\"\n\nPyramid Lake itself is a special place. Located 35 miles north of Reno, the lake stretches 27 miles long and is surrounded by dry, red hills. Its water comes from snow melting in the Sierra Nevada mountains, flowing down the Truckee River. The lake changes colors, from deep blue to silver and gold, depending on the sunlight.\n\nLong ago, the Lahontan cutthroat trout lived only in Pyramid Lake and nearby rivers. They grew big quickly because they had plenty of smaller fish to eat. They even swam west to Lake Tahoe and Donner Lake. In the 1800s, explorers like John Fremont were amazed by their size and taste.\n\nBy the 1920s, overfishing began to harm the trout population. Then, in 1906, a dam was built on the Truckee River, cutting off water to the lake. The lake’s water level dropped, and the trout couldn’t swim upstream to lay eggs. By 1938, the fish had disappeared from the lake. Scientists believed they were extinct.\n\nBut there was hope. Some experts thought the trout might still exist in a hidden place. In the 1970s, a scientist named Don Duff found unusual trout in a tiny creek near Pilot Peak, on the Nevada-Utah border. The fish didn’t look like the local trout. Duff sent samples to a trout expert, who believed they were the same as the Pyramid Lake Lahontan cutthroats. However, he couldn’t prove it at the time.\n\nThe fish had likely been moved to the remote creek by early biologists in the 1900s. Most didn’t survive, but a small group did. Still, there were fewer than 400 fish left. Restoring their population seemed impossible, and no agency wanted to take on the challenge.\n\nOne man, Bryce Nielson, refused to give up. A fisheries biologist, Nielson built a small hatchery near the creek to raise the fish. It wasn’t easy—many eggs didn’t hatch, and others didn’t survive. But Nielson kept trying, driven by his love for these trout.\n\nAt one point, Nielson put the fish into a pond with minnows to see if they would grow like their ancestors. To his surprise, they grew very quickly. This success led to the first group of eggs being sent to a larger hatchery in 1995. Today, these fish are raised by the thousands.\n\nIn the 2000s, scientists finally confirmed the fish’s identity using DNA tests. By comparing DNA from museum samples of the original Pyramid Lake trout to the Pilot Peak trout, they proved they were the same species.\n\nThe big question was: Could these fish still grow to their old size in Pyramid Lake? The answer is now becoming clear. Since their reintroduction in 2006, some of the fish have grown to over 20 pounds. Anglers are thrilled to catch these giants.\n\n\"This is the busiest spring fishing season I’ve ever had,\" said Rob Anderson, a fishing guide.\n\nSo far, 900,000 of these trout have been released back into Pyramid Lake, with more on the way. In a few years, this fish’s incredible comeback might lead to even bigger catches—and an amazing story of hope for nature."

        "gpt": "LOS ANGELES — A fast-changing virus has jumped from plants to honeybees. It is spreading and adding to the collapse of bee colonies, which are very important for farming, says a new study.\n\nThe virus, called tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV), is carried by pollen. It harms soy plants and was found during regular checks of honeybees at a U.S. Department of Agriculture lab. Researchers discovered the virus grows inside bees and spreads to mites that move between bees. This study was published in the journal *mBio*.\n\nThis is the first time bees have been found infected by a pollen-carried virus that spreads through their bodies and hives. The virus was found in all parts of the bee except its eyes.\n\nBees are crucial for pollinating crops. They help grow about 90 types of plants worldwide, a service worth $14 billion each year. But bee colonies are dying off. Scientists blame a mix of viruses, pesticides, and beekeeping practices that weaken bees' immune systems.\n\nIn California, almond farmers spend $239 million each year to rent over 1 million beehives. These costs are rising as more bees die.\n\nOnly a few plant viruses are spread by pollen, and even fewer can infect insects. This makes the problem of colony collapse disorder more complicated, experts said.\n\nTRSV mutates quickly, helping it avoid the bee’s immune system. Other viruses, like bird flu and HIV, act in a similar way. These mutations allow the virus to infect different hosts, said Yan Ping Chen, a USDA bee scientist and lead author of the study.\n\nThe exact role of TRSV in bee deaths is still unknown because bees face many threats at once, Chen said. \"We don’t know the full cause of colony collapse disorder, but we do see that TRSV and other viruses are linked to lower survival rates during winter.\"\n\nThe study found that TRSV, along with another virus called Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus, was more common in weak bee colonies. TRSV infections were highest in winter, affecting 22.5% of bees.\n\nVarroa mites, which are harmful parasites, were also found to carry the virus. However, they were not infected themselves. Researchers think the mites help spread the virus between bees. It is unclear if the mites do anything more than spread the virus mechanically.\n\nScientists are also unsure if infected bees can pass the virus to healthy plants or if bees keep getting infected from visiting plants.\n\nRandy Oliver, a biologist and beekeeper not involved in the study, said, \"I wouldn’t say this virus is the main cause of colony collapse, but it shows how little we understand about bee diseases.\"\n\nSome activists worry about pesticides called neonicotinoids, which are banned in Europe. One study linked these pesticides to weaker bee immune systems and more virus reproduction. Another study found 35 different pesticides in pollen collected by bees in five U.S. states. However, neonicotinoids were only found in pollen from one apple orchard.\n\nAnother study found that feeding bees high-fructose corn syrup, instead of letting them survive on their own honey, made them more likely to get sick and suffer from pesticides.\n\nLast year, USDA and Environmental Protection Agency scientists reviewed research on colony collapse disorder. They found that pesticides, diseases, and poor nutrition, often caused by a lack of natural plants, were the main reasons for bee deaths."

        "gpt": "DES MOINES, Iowa — A man from Bangladesh, Fazle Hasan Abed, won the 2015 World Food Prize on July 1. He started a nonprofit group called BRAC, which has helped over 150 million people escape poverty.\n\nAbed created BRAC in the 1970s to help Bangladesh recover from a deadly typhoon and a war for independence. At that time, Bangladesh was one of the poorest countries in the world. BRAC, which first focused on helping rural areas, has grown into one of the largest organizations fighting poverty. It now works in Africa and Asia and plans to expand to 10 more countries.\n\n\"Poverty isn’t just about not having money or a job. It’s also about not having chances for education, health care, or a better future,\" said Abed, who is 79 years old.\n\nThe World Food Prize is given to people who improve food quality and availability. It was started in 1986 by Norman Borlaug, a Nobel Prize winner. The prize includes $250,000 and is awarded in Des Moines, Iowa. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack announced Abed as the winner.\n\nKenneth Quinn, the president of the World Food Prize, praised Abed for turning BRAC into a global organization. He said BRAC is the largest and one of the most effective nonprofits in the world, with over 100,000 workers. Quinn added that BRAC focuses on helping the poorest people, especially those who don’t have enough food and face the hardest struggles.\n\nBRAC started by working to lower child and baby death rates. It provided health care and other services. Abed also wanted to help women contribute to the economy. BRAC taught women how to farm better and grow extra crops to sell.\n\nAbed believes women are key to solving poverty. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Vilsack said BRAC’s focus on involving women in fields like science, farming, and technology is important for both local and global communities.\n\nBRAC estimates that over a billion people live on less than $1.25 a day. Many of them live on even less and are considered extremely poor. To help, BRAC started a program that gives the poorest people a small weekly payment, so they don’t have to beg or take very low-paying jobs. The program also teaches them how to save money and manage it wisely. Participants receive a gift, like a cow or chickens, to help them earn more money and become self-sufficient.\n\nAbed believes poor people can solve poverty themselves if they are given the right tools and opportunities. \"The hard work is done by the poor themselves to defeat poverty,\" he said.\n\nThanks to efforts like BRAC’s, poverty in Bangladesh has dropped from 56.7% in 1991 to 31.5% in 2010, according to the United Nations.\n\nAbed will receive the World Food Prize in October at a ceremony in Des Moines."

        "gpt": "WASHINGTON — On Sunday night, President Barack Obama gave a rare speech from the Oval Office. He promised that the United States will defeat a new kind of terror threat that tries to \"poison the minds\" of people everywhere. He spoke to calm Americans after recent attacks in Paris and California.\n\n\"After so much war, many Americans wonder if this problem has no quick solution,\" Obama said. \"The threat of terrorism is real, but we will beat it,\" he added.\n\nHis speech came after a shooting last Wednesday in San Bernardino, California, where 14 people were killed and 21 were hurt. Police say a married couple carried out the attack. The wife had posted on Facebook, pledging loyalty to the Islamic State (ISIS) group and its leader.\n\nObama said there was no proof the couple was directed by a larger terror group or part of a bigger plan. However, he said, \"They had turned to the dark path of radicalization.\"\n\n\"This was an act of terrorism meant to kill innocent people,\" he said during his 13-minute speech.\n\nThe Oval Office is a special place for presidential speeches, and Obama rarely uses it. This time, he spoke during prime time to make sure people heard his message, especially during the busy presidential campaign season.\n\nStill, many critics were not satisfied. Obama did not announce a big change in how the U.S. fights ISIS. He also did not introduce new plans, showing that he believes in his current strategy but also that there are no easy solutions.\n\n\"Nothing in the speech tonight will ease people's fears,\" said Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican running for president, on Fox News.\n\nObama asked for tech companies to work with the government to stop attackers from using technology to hide. He also urged Congress to pass laws to stop people on the no-fly list from buying guns and to approve military actions against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.\n\nHe asked Americans not to turn against Muslims, saying ISIS wants to create a war between the West and Islam. He also called on Muslims to help fight extremism.\n\nRadical Islam spreading in American communities, he said, \"is a real problem that Muslims must face head-on.\"\n\nObama also asked the State and Homeland Security departments to review the fiancé visa program. This is how the female shooter in California entered the U.S. He also mentioned a visa waiver program that Congress is reviewing, but the White House later clarified he meant the fiancé program.\n\nObama repeated his call for stricter gun laws. He said no matter how good law enforcement is, they can’t catch every potential shooter. He said it’s important to make it harder for dangerous people to get guns.\n\n\"What we can and must do is make it harder for them to kill,\" he said.\n\nHowever, it will be difficult for Obama to get Congress, led by Republicans, to agree to any gun control laws. Last Thursday, the Senate rejected a law that would stop people suspected of terrorism from buying guns. Gun rights supporters say this would be unfair to people not convicted of crimes.\n\nCongress also hasn’t agreed on a plan to authorize more military force against ISIS. Obama’s proposal has been stuck since February.\n\nObama said he still opposes sending large numbers of U.S. troops to fight on the ground in the Middle East. He also didn’t support ideas like a no-fly zone or safe areas in Syria, which some have suggested.\n\n\"Our success won’t come from tough talk, giving in to fear, or abandoning our values,\" he said. \"We will win by being strong, smart, and determined.\"\n\nAfter the speech, Obama went to a scheduled event at the Kennedy Center Honors in Washington.\n\nCritics, including some from his own party, have questioned Obama’s strategy. Earlier on Sunday, Hillary Clinton, his former secretary of state and now a Democratic presidential candidate, said the U.S. is \"not winning\" the fight against ISIS.\n\nObama has said ISIS is contained in Iraq and Syria. But the group has carried out attacks in other places, like Lebanon, Turkey, and Egypt, where they brought down a Russian plane.\n\nThe Nov. 13 attacks in Paris were ISIS's most serious actions in Europe, killing 130 people and injuring hundreds more.\n\nThe threat came even closer to Americans last week when a husband and wife attacked a holiday lunch in San Bernardino. The husband was born in the U.S., and the wife was originally from Pakistan. \n\nThe FBI is investigating the attack as a possible act of terror. If confirmed, it would be the deadliest attack by Islamic extremists in the U.S. since September 11, 2001.\n\nA U.S. official said the woman pledged loyalty to ISIS in a Facebook post just as the couple began their attack. Facebook confirmed the post was made around the time of the shooting."

        "gpt": "BATES COUNTY, Mo. — Schools in America are under pressure to prepare students better because of global competition for jobs and research. Different ideas have been suggested, like year-round school, longer school days, or even classes on Saturdays.\n\nBut some schools are trying a new idea: a four-day school week. Students don’t go to school on Mondays but attend longer classes from Tuesday to Friday to meet state-required hours. Teachers, however, still work on Mondays for training and planning.\n\nPeople have mixed opinions about this. Critics say it harms students’ education. Supporters believe it helps teachers do a better job. Students? One senior said she’s excited to sleep in on Mondays.\n\nSchool leaders in these districts say the four-day week is working. For example, Chris Fine, superintendent of Lathrop schools, said their ACT scores are the best in 10 years, and teachers are happy. Lathrop was the first district in Missouri to switch to four days in 2010.\n\nMost schools with this schedule are in small, rural areas. For example, Miami R-1, a small school south of Kansas City, has so few students that its boys play football for a nearby town. In these areas, Mondays are sometimes called \"go-to-town days.\"\n\nMissouri has a rule: if a school’s performance drops a lot, it must return to five days. So far, no school has had to switch back.\n\nOriginally, the four-day week was meant to save money on buses and utilities in small districts. However, savings have been small. Miami R-1 switched to four days this year, not to save money but to give teachers more time to prepare. Superintendent Frank Dahman believes better-prepared teachers lead to better students.\n\nNot everyone agrees. Jennifer Davis, from the National Center on Time & Learning, says cutting a school day is a bad idea. She argues kids need more time in school to compete globally, not less.\n\nChild care on Mondays is another issue. Rural areas may have fewer problems because parents or grandparents are often nearby. But in cities, where parents work outside the home, a four-day week could cause challenges. Some worry that kids from low-income families might not have safe places to go on Mondays.\n\nDespite concerns, some parents and teachers in rural areas like the change. For example, Miami parent Amanda McConnell said teachers need the extra planning time, and kids are still in school the same total hours, just spread across fewer days.\n\nAt Miami R-1, students now attend school 14 fewer hours a year than before, but they still meet state requirements. Classes start 15 minutes earlier and end 20 minutes later. Teachers use Mondays to catch up on lesson planning and learn new technology, such as iPads.\n\nSome students also like the change. Senior David Weaver said he uses Mondays to work a 10-hour job. Others, like volleyball player Ashley Jellison, use Mondays to catch up on homework after busy weekends.\n\nNot everyone is happy. Senior Dylan Good thinks the extra day off is a waste and prefers the five-day schedule.\n\nSome parents are unsure about what to do with younger kids on Mondays.

        "gpt": "YANGON, Myanmar — Linn Naing, with his skin darkened by the sun and a bamboo hat tied under his chin, climbs onto his black Hero bicycle like a cowboy mounting a horse. He adjusts the red cushions in his sidecar, then pushes the pedals with his flip-flopped feet, moving forward to earn an honest living.\n\nWearing a blue wrap called a *lungyi* and carrying a cellphone in his pocket, Linn Naing rides past old colonial buildings with faded yellow and brown paint. He passes billboards for toothpaste, luxury cars, and an Internet cafe called Google.\n\nIn the distance, tall, shiny white apartment buildings rise high, showing how quickly this city of 7.4 million is changing. New white taxis zip around old, slow buses, hinting at better times for some.\n\nYet in 2015, there is still space on these roads for bicycle sidecars like Linn Naing’s.\n\n“Buses are cheap but very hot. Taxis are cool but too expensive,” says the 36-year-old, who wears a clean white shirt with his *lungyi.* “I’ve been doing this job for eight years, and it’s still good. With all the traffic these days, sidecars are often faster, so people like them.”\n\nIn many cities in Southeast Asia, bicycle sidecars and rickshaws have disappeared. They’ve been replaced by fast, noisy motorcycles and scooters. But in Yangon, motorbikes were banned from the city center over 10 years ago. The story goes that the military banned them after a motorcycle gang called the Scorpions got in the way of a general’s motorcade. Even though military rule has ended, the ban remains.\n\nFor Linn Naing and over 26,000 other sidecar drivers in Yangon, this is good news. Sidecars are a cheap option for short trips, costing between 20 and 50 cents. Linn Naing earns about $10 a day taking women home from the market, kids to school, and tourists to temples. That’s a decent income in a country where most people earn about $1,000 a year.\n\nStarting this job, however, is expensive. A bike with a sidecar costs about $200, and a license costs $300. Linn Naing owns his sidecar, so he doesn’t have to pay $2 or $3 a day to rent one like many drivers do.\n\nThe design of the sidecar hasn’t changed much in 85 years. It’s said to have been invented by a mechanic named Mg Nyeit, who wanted to create a cheaper way to travel. Sidecars in Myanmar are made of wood and have two seats. One seat faces forward, and the other faces backward, so passengers sit back to back.\n\nA red metal bracket connects the sidecar to the bike. The handlebars often have a light and a bell, and a small license plate sticks out at the front.\n\nZaw Zaw Co, a local artist, thinks sidecars are both useful and meaningful. “They’re helpful for carrying things or going to places buses can’t reach,” he says. “They’ll survive because some people will always need them.”\n\nIn 2011, Zaw Zaw Co started painting sidecars in his artwork. He paints them floating over old maps of Myanmar, showing places like Mandalay and the Delta region.\n\n“I wanted to paint something that shows the working class and their struggles,” he says. “Most drivers do this job because they didn’t get much education and don’t have many other options.”\n\nSo far, he’s made nearly 100 paintings in this series. To get inspired, he rides in sidecars through the city, feeling the breeze on his face, the bumps in the road, and the sounds and smells around him.\n\n“I just try to enjoy the ride,” he says. “Sometimes I worry about the driver—if he’s too hot or too tired. But then I just let myself enjoy the moment.”"

        "gpt": "PHILADELPHIA — Scientists are debating over \"The Mystery of Oblong Blobs.\"\n\nMost experts think these tiny, cigar-shaped blobs, found in fossils, are remains of ancient color granules. These granules could reveal the colors of winged dinosaurs.\n\nBut Alison E. Moyer, a Ph.D. student at North Carolina State University, has another idea. She thinks these shapes might actually be marks left by ancient bacteria. The blobs are so small and similar in shape that both ideas could be true, she says.\n\n\"You have to be careful because they look alike,\" Moyer explained. Her study was published in the journal *Scientific Reports.*\n\nSome scientists strongly disagree. One researcher, Matthew D. Shawkey, called the study \"bad science\" on Twitter. Others are more open to Moyer's work, saying it challenges old ideas in a useful way.\n\nIn paleontology, debates like this are common since there’s no way to go back in time. Instead, Moyer used a modern \"time machine\" — a chicken.\n\nSince birds are related to dinosaurs, Moyer studied chicken feathers. She grew bacteria on them and compared the bacteria to the blobs in fossilized dinosaur feathers. She also compared them to the color granules in modern feathers. The fossils looked more like bacteria, but she admits they could still be color granules.\n\nHer work was guided by Mary H. Schweitzer, a well-known paleontologist, and co-authored by Ken Lacovara, a Drexel University professor.\n\nShawkey, who helped identify black feathers on a famous winged dinosaur called *Archaeopteryx* in 2012, had a big problem with one part of Moyer's study. She showed two images side by side — one of bacteria on chicken feathers and one of fossil blobs. Shawkey said this was misleading because the bacteria in the chicken feathers are four times bigger than the fossil blobs. Moyer argued they are only twice as big. Either way, both sizes match known bacteria, so the debate continues.\n\nMoyer also said chemical tests on the fossils haven’t given clear answers. Johan Lindgren, a scientist from Sweden, supported Moyer’s cautious approach. \"We need more data,\" he said.\n\nSo how did scientists decide what color dinosaurs might have been? They compared the shapes of fossil blobs to the shapes of color granules in modern birds. Based on this, they guessed some dinosaurs were black, gray, or brown.\n\nBut Moyer says there’s still a lot to figure out. \"There's a ton of work that needs to be done,\" she said."

        "gpt": "DALLAS — A 14-year-old Muslim boy, Ahmed Mohamed, was arrested after his teacher thought his homemade clock was a bomb. This led to criticism of the school and claims that fear of Muslims, or Islamophobia, might have influenced the decision.\n\nAhmed was invited to the White House and attended an astronomy night on October 19. However, he also got a three-day suspension from school. He says the school made him serve it even after they realized it was just a clock. His family later removed him from the school.\n\nAhmed’s suspension highlights strict school rules about discipline, which became common in the 1990s. But many schools in the U.S. are now changing these rules. Instead of suspensions or calling the police, schools are trying to use counseling and less harsh punishments.\n\nMichael Gilbert, a leader in promoting better ways to handle discipline, said, \"If we can’t tell the difference between a real problem and a small one, the problem isn’t the kid—it’s us.\"\n\nBig school districts like those in New York, Los Angeles, and Denver are moving away from strict policies. Some states are also changing rules. For example, Connecticut now limits suspensions for young kids, Texas no longer treats skipping school as a crime, and Oregon has set rules on when suspensions can be used for younger students.\n\nIn 2014, the Obama administration asked schools to stop sending kids to court for minor problems. They encouraged training teachers to solve conflicts peacefully.\n\nRussell Skiba, an expert on school fairness, said changes are happening at every level—federal, state, and local. But he added that many schools still lack the resources or are afraid to try new methods.\n\nIn Denver, schools started a new program in 2008 to reduce suspensions and expulsions. Before this, many minority students were getting punished more than others. A student, Margarita Atencio, shared her story. She was suspended in seventh grade after being attacked by other girls. When it happened again, she was expelled. This made her feel abandoned. Now 19, she has graduated high school and helps others as a youth leader.\n\nEldridge Greer, who works in Denver schools, said the number of suspensions and expulsions has dropped a lot since the new program began. Before, students might be suspended for arguing, but nothing was done to fix their behavior. Now, they talk with school staff to solve the problem.\n\nDaniel Kim, who works with students in Denver, said the new rules help everyone, but punishments for minorities, especially Black students, are still higher than for white students.\n\nFormer U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan said suspensions and expulsions often depend on a student’s race and background. He pointed out that sometimes bias is obvious, like when Ahmed was arrested for holding a clock mistaken for a bomb. Other times, bias is harder to see.\n\nAfter Ahmed’s arrest, police said he didn’t intend to scare anyone. The school hasn’t explained its actions, saying privacy laws prevent them from sharing details.\n\nDan Losen, a civil rights expert, said suspension rates are starting to level off, and racial gaps are slowly shrinking. \n\nAt Ed White Middle School in San Antonio, suspensions have dropped by 72% since they started a program to solve problems through discussion. Principal Philip Carney said students are now even solving their own conflicts, with teachers only helping to guide the process."

A \"polar vortex,\" bringing extremely cold air, is expected to cause record-breaking, below-zero temperatures in many parts of the U.S.\n\nThis cold air, spinning in a circle, will hit more than half the U.S. on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday. Wind chill warnings are in place from Montana to Alabama. Temperatures could drop to 25 below zero in Fargo, N.D., 31 below in International Falls, Minn., and 15 below in Indianapolis and Chicago.\n\n\"It's dangerously cold,\" said Butch Dye, a weather expert from Missouri.\n\nParts of the Midwest were hit with up to a foot of snow. People worked to clear their driveways and stocked up on food before even colder weather arrived. \n\nIn Chicago, 5 to 7 inches of snow fell overnight, and more snow was expected in Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan. Areas in western Tennessee could get several inches, while Kentucky might see 1 to 3 inches.\n\nTemperatures in Chicago were expected to drop to 11 degrees by Sunday evening and then plunge to 15 below zero overnight, likely breaking records. Earlier on Sunday, northern Minnesota and Grand Forks, N.D., had temperatures around 20 below zero.\n\nIt hasn’t been this cold in many parts of the U.S. for nearly 20 years. Experts are reminding people to wear layers, hats, and gloves to avoid frostbite and hypothermia, which can happen quickly in such extreme cold.\n\nIn St. Louis, grocery store shelves were cleared of bread, milk, and other essentials. Michigan residents rushed to stores too. \"I made my husband go shopping last night,\" said Kim Tarnopol, who was also buying cold medicine for her daughter.\n\nTravel was affected early Sunday. In New York City, a plane slid off a taxiway due to snow after landing safely. No one was hurt, but icy runways caused delays. In Chicago, about 1,200 flights were canceled at O’Hare and Midway airports. Flights were also canceled in Boston, Memphis, and Nashville.\n\nRoads were especially dangerous in the Midwest. In Indiana, parts of Interstate 70 were covered in snow. In Missouri, the cold made rock salt less effective at melting ice. \"If it gets too unsafe, we may stop operations,\" said Marie Elliott from Missouri's Department of Transportation.\n\nSchools in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana canceled classes for Monday. Southern states like Georgia and Alabama are also preparing for unusually cold temperatures, with highs only in the single digits on Tuesday.\n\nIn Kentucky, farmer David Nickell moved his animals to shelter and stocked up on supplies. The 2009 ice storm, which left many without power, is still fresh in his memory. \"We hope this cold doesn’t last long,\" he said. \"But we’ve learned how important it is to be prepared.\"\n\nDown south in Louisiana, the cold wasn’t a big threat to citrus crops. Hugh French, manager of Stella Plantation, said they had already harvested the best fruit. Any fruit left on the trees wasn’t as important, so the cold wouldn’t cause major problems.\n\nMeanwhile, football fans braved the cold at Lambeau Field in Wisconsin, where it was 5 degrees at kickoff for a game between the Green Bay Packers and the San Francisco 49ers. \"We wore all our snowboarding gear,\" said 49ers fan Jeff Giardinelli. \"We’re ready for the wind when it comes.\""

        "gpt": "BOSTON — A survey by Harvard University, shared on Wednesday, found that about half of young adults (ages 18 to 29) think the U.S. criminal justice system is unfair. Most don’t believe protests sparked by the deaths of Black men killed by police will lead to big changes.\n\nThe survey, done from March 18 to April 1, comes during rising anger over the death of Freddie Gray. Gray, a 25-year-old man from Baltimore, died from a spinal cord injury while in police custody. This week, protests in Baltimore turned violent.\n\nPeople looted and burned businesses, and there were fights with police after Gray’s funeral on Monday. The governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, sent the National Guard to help. Baltimore’s mayor, Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, ordered a curfew for one week.\n\nJohn Della Volpe, who leads polling at Harvard’s Institute of Politics, said the results show that young people want real changes in the justice system, not just talk. \n\n“What they want is a serious, non-political discussion about this,” he said. “Even before the events in Baltimore, only a small group of young people believed protests would bring change.”\n\nThe survey included over 3,000 young people across the U.S. It found that 49% of millennials have little or no trust in the justice system to treat people fairly, no matter their race or ethnicity. Another 49% have some or a lot of trust in the system.\n\nThe gap is bigger among Black millennials. About 66% of Black millennials have little or no trust in the justice system, compared to 43% of white millennials and 53% of Hispanic millennials.\n\nBlack millennials also showed stronger support for the \"Black Lives Matter\" movement than white or Hispanic millennials. This movement grew after police killed Black men in cities like Ferguson, Missouri, and New York City.\n\nStill, most millennials don’t think the movement will bring major change. Only 39% said the protests would be \"somewhat\" or \"very\" effective.\n\n“This generation is more doubtful,” Della Volpe said. “They will get involved if they feel inspired, if it seems important, and if they believe change is possible. Right now, though, they feel like no one is listening to them.”\n\nMany young people strongly support some ideas from protest movements. For example, about 80% think requiring police officers to wear body cameras would help.\n\nThe survey also asked about other topics. About 57% of millennials said they support sending U.S. troops to fight the Islamic State group in the Middle East. More young adults now support attacking countries first if they might become a threat.\n\nDella Volpe said this shows a growing interest in stronger U.S. foreign policies among young people.\n\nThe survey also found that over one-third of young women said they have personal experience with sexual assault. This could be through their own experience or someone close to them. Of those women, 91% said the assault happened outside of college campuses.\n\n“This isn’t just a college problem,” Della Volpe said. “It’s a bigger issue in society as a whole.”"

        "gpt": "ARLINGTON, Va. — Teacher Michael Coughlin often learns about his students' difficult journeys to the U.S. and what they left behind through their essays. Sometimes, they tell him about a court date or ask for help finding an immigration lawyer.\n\nMost of these students at H-B Woodlawn Secondary Program are determined to succeed, but \"they are also very scared because they don't know what will happen to them,\" Coughlin says.\n\nSchools in the U.S. are one of the few places where children and teens who cross the border alone are guaranteed help. They get lessons in subjects like science and can even get eye exams. While waiting for immigration cases to be processed, most of these children live with family or sponsors who are told they must enroll the kids in school.\n\nSchools in big cities like Washington, Houston, and Miami are seeing more of these students. They expect even more to come in the fall. \"The schools want to help, but it's a hard job,\" said Randy Capps, a researcher at the Migration Policy Institute, a group that studies immigration.\n\nThe government estimates that 90,000 children, mostly from El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, could arrive alone by this fall. Next year, the number may rise to 145,000. Many come to join a parent, escaping gangs or poverty in their home countries.\n\nIn school, these children often need extra help, like learning English or getting mental health support. But schools are already struggling because of budget cuts.\n\nIn Miami, the school board asked for federal money after 300 immigrant students, many from Honduras, enrolled late in the school year. Superintendent Alberto Carvalho said the district has a \"moral and legal duty\" to teach these kids, even if some can’t read or write in English or Spanish. He said the district spends about $1,950 more per student than it gets from the state. \"These kids need food, clothes, care, and then they need to learn,\" Carvalho said.\n\nIn May, Education Secretary Arne Duncan and Attorney General Eric Holder reminded schools that a 1982 Supreme Court decision says all children, no matter their immigration status, have the right to go to school.\n\nKristyn Peck, who works with refugee programs, says schools often call her for advice about these students. \"These kids have been through a lot,\" she said. \"They faced danger that made them leave home, had tough experiences on the journey, and sometimes had more trauma at the border. They are special kids with big needs.\"\n\nPatricia Chiancone, a counselor in Maryland, hears many sad stories. She has met girls who were attacked on the journey, kids whose parents or siblings were killed by gangs, and teens who left home after losing their farms. \"We see death certificates and letters explaining why they had to leave,\" she said.\n\nAt Coughlin's school, students learning English can stay until their 20s. In the last two years, more students have arrived alone. Many work late at night in restaurants or cleaning to pay for lawyers or to repay relatives who paid for them to come to the U.S.\n\nRonald Pojoy knows how hard it can be. He came alone from Guatemala in 2007 when he was 15 to join his mother. \"I wanted to give up sometimes because I had so much to learn,\" he said. \"It was really hard to work and go to school. I was so tired.\" Now 21, Pojoy graduated last month from Liberty High School in Houston, a school with many immigrant students. The school also helps students find legal and community support. \"We have to show students that what they’re doing matters and that they can succeed,\" said teacher Eddison James.\n\nOne of Coughlin's students, Milsa Martinez, is 20. She came from El Salvador at 18 after her parents, who left 14 years earlier, sent for her. She traveled with two smugglers and about 30 others, including young kids. She said a woman with foot problems was left behind because she couldn’t keep walking. When Milsa was caught at the border, she was treated as a minor because she looked young. Now, she works evenings at a hospital taking out trash. She dreams of going to college but fears deportation, even though she thinks her immigration case is closed. \"If I graduate from college, it could help me here or in another country,\" she said. \"But I want to stay here.\"\n\nThe future for these children is uncertain. A law gives kids from outside Mexico and Canada a chance to have an immigration hearing. Delays often mean they stay in the U.S. for a long time. Republicans want to change the law and have stopped President Barack Obama's $3.7 billion plan to help manage the growing number of cases. The Justice Department says cases involving kids and families will be moved to the front of the court line. Some kids may qualify to stay for humanitarian reasons.\n\n\"I have hope for these kids who stick with it, learn English, and graduate,\" Coughlin said. \"But I feel sad for those who can’t. It’s heartbreaking. The challenges are big, and not all of them will make it.\""

        "gpt": "Milk sales in the U.S. are at their lowest in over 30 years, so the dairy industry is fighting back with a $500 million plan. This plan includes new products, like milk cartons that don’t need to be kept cold until opened.\n\nIn 2013, Americans bought about 52 billion pounds of milk, which is around 6 billion gallons. This is the lowest amount since 1982. People are drinking less milk because of changing habits, more drink choices, and fewer new dairy products.\n\nAlthough people still drink the same amount of beverages overall, milk is not as popular. If the new campaign doesn’t work, milk sales might drop so much that milk becomes unimportant to most people, says Tom Gallagher, head of Dairy Management Inc., a group funded by dairy farmers to promote dairy products.\n\nThe campaign is a team effort by Dairy Management and seven partners, including Dairy Farmers of America. Monica Massey, a leader in Dairy Farmers of America, says they need new ideas, like flavored milk and sports drinks made with dairy. She also says they can’t just expect people to grab a regular gallon of milk from the shelf anymore.\n\nTo attract kids, milk is being sold in fun packages shaped like a cow’s head. Milk is also being packaged in ways that don’t need refrigeration until opened, like juice boxes. People want drinks that are easy to grab and take with them, Massey explains.\n\nEven though Americans still like to buy milk cold, businesses could save money if milk didn’t need refrigerated trucks or storage, Gallagher adds.\n\nThe partners in the campaign include big companies like Coca-Cola, Kroger, and Shamrock Farms. The campaign could cost more than $500 million, especially with money spent on new milk packaging plants. Most of the money will come from dairy companies and farmers, who pay into a program called the \"dairy checkoff.\" This program collects 15 cents for every 100 pounds of milk farmers produce.\n\nDairy Management, which runs the dairy checkoff program, helps with testing, marketing, and creating new products. They’ve worked with fast-food chains like McDonald’s to sell more dairy products. Gallagher says McDonald’s spends more on promoting milk and cheese than Dairy Management could ever afford.\n\nOlder ad campaigns, like \"Got Milk?\" didn’t stop the drop in sales. Gallagher says the problem wasn’t the ads but the lack of exciting products to match them. For example, Wisconsin milk is mostly used for cheese, and Dairy Management has had more success promoting cheese, especially for pizza and fast food.\n\nEven small changes in how people use milk can make a big difference. Quaker Oats, for example, now suggests cooking oatmeal with milk instead of water. This could lead to millions more gallons of milk being sold, especially since fewer people are eating cereal with milk.\n\nNot everyone supports the dairy industry’s efforts. The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM), which promotes a vegan diet, criticizes the dairy checkoff program. They call it a hidden tax and argue that Dairy Management pushes unhealthy, high-fat foods like cheese through deals with fast-food chains."

        "gpt": "KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. — The weather was terrible, with heavy rain pouring down. Dennis Jenkins, standing in a scrap yard near where space shuttles once launched, wiped water off his glasses and nose as he looked around.\n\nIn the yard, there were piles of old equipment: a box full of keyboards and wires, file cabinets tipped over, and soggy cardboard boxes falling apart in the rain. These boxes had NASA stickers on them, marked \"Critical space item\" and \"Handle with extreme care.\"\n\nJenkins focused on two tall escape baskets by a fence. These baskets were once used as emergency slides for astronauts in case something went wrong during a shuttle launch. His team carefully moved the baskets with a forklift and loaded them into a trailer. Jenkins checked the trailer, adjusted a canvas cover, and gave a thumbs-up. \"Perfect,\" he said.\n\nJenkins worked with space shuttles for over 30 years. Now, at 57, he helps the California Science Center prepare a special display for the shuttle Endeavour. The museum wants to show the shuttle standing upright, as if ready for launch. To do this, they need thousands of parts scattered across NASA facilities, museums, and other places in the U.S. Many of these parts are rare and cannot be replaced.\n\nFor the last year, Jenkins has traveled across the country, searching NASA scrap yards and contacting old coworkers to find the pieces needed for the display. Before the shuttle program ended in 2011, museums and aerospace centers competed fiercely to receive one of NASA’s four orbiters. But NASA also had millions of other shuttle parts, which were no longer needed. While NASA saved some parts for future programs, they gave away or scrapped many others to save money.\n\nWhen the California Science Center decided to display Endeavour upright, they realized they needed many of these forgotten parts. The problem was, there weren’t good records of where everything was stored.\n\nJenkins started his career young, helping launch America’s first shuttle, Columbia, in 1981 when he was just 24. He worked on the software for loading and controlling the shuttle’s fuel. By 26, he was a senior engineer, solving problems and improving the shuttle system. He even helped develop a launch site in California, though it was canceled after the Challenger disaster in 1986.\n\nThe shuttle program started to wind down after the Columbia tragedy in 2003. When the shuttles retired in 2011, Jenkins helped transport them to museums, including Endeavour’s journey through Los Angeles streets. He thought that would be his last shuttle job, but the California Science Center hired him to oversee Endeavour’s new display.\n\nNow, Jenkins is one of the few people still working with shuttle parts. \"Dennis knows everything about the shuttles,\" said Jeffrey Rudolph, president of the California Science Center. \"He’s doing this because he loves it.\"\n\nJenkins spends much of his time tracking down rare parts. Only six space shuttles were ever built, so there aren’t many spares. He calls old coworkers and even people who packed the parts years ago. \"They have great memories,\" Jenkins said. \"They often remember exactly where they put something.\"\n\nHe has found parts in places like Utah, New Orleans, and Washington, D.C. Some items are huge, like 60-foot steel beams, which had to be transported on trucks. Others are tiny, like a small piece of metal that connects the shuttle to its fuel tank.\n\nOne of the hardest parts to find was a 30-pound bolt that attaches the shuttle’s nose to its tank. Jenkins looked for it in Florida and Texas, but it seemed to be gone. Making a new one would have been very expensive and complicated. After a year of searching, someone in Houston found a spare bolt — in a desk drawer.\n\nNot all parts go straight to the museum. Some, like the escape baskets, are sent to a workshop for repairs first. The museum hired Tom Wilkes and his team to restore certain items. Wilkes said working with Jenkins is like working with \"Mr. Space Shuttle.\" His team even uses a book Jenkins wrote about the shuttle as a reference.\n\nAs the rain poured down at Kennedy Space Center, Jenkins stood in a storage shed filled with more boxes and crates, many labeled \"Hold for California Science Center.\" He sighed. \"I’d much rather be here launching shuttles,\" he said. \"But I’m lucky I still get to work with them in some way.\"\n\nA crane operator called Jenkins over to help load more parts onto a truck bound for California. There was still a lot of work to do."

Obama also gave the Presidential Medal of Freedom, an award created by Kennedy, to several famous Americans, including Bill Clinton and Oprah Winfrey.\n\nOn Wednesday, Obama and former President Bill Clinton visited Kennedy's grave at Arlington National Cemetery. They were joined by Ethel Kennedy, the widow of Robert F. Kennedy. The group climbed the hill to the gravesite, which has an eternal flame burning. First Lady Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton helped their husbands place a wreath of white flowers at the site. Everyone stood silently as \"Taps\" played and the U.S. flag flew at half-staff. They then greeted Kennedy family members.\n\nEarlier that day, Obama gave the Presidential Medal of Freedom to 16 people at the White House. The award honors achievements in areas like sports, entertainment, science, and public service. Obama said these people show \"the beauty of the human spirit\" and inspire Americans.\n\nThe ceremony took place in the East Room of the White House, with guests like Hillary Clinton, her daughter Chelsea, and filmmaker Steven Spielberg. Obama called it one of his favorite events. The medal's modern version was created by Kennedy, but he was killed before he could give out the first awards in 1963.\n\nObama spoke about each medal winner. He praised Bill Clinton for his work as president and his efforts to help people around the world after leaving office. Obama joked about the advice Clinton has given him, even on the golf course. As a teenager, Clinton had met Kennedy in the White House Rose Garden before the assassination.\n\nObama also honored Sally Ride, the first American woman in space, saying she inspired young girls to dream big. Ride's partner, Tam O'Shaughnessy, accepted the award for her, as Ride passed away last year. Obama highlighted how some recipients overcame challenges due to being gay, black, female, or Asian. He shared how Oprah Winfrey's bosses once wanted her to change her name, but she proved they were wrong.\n\nLater, Obama was scheduled to give a speech at a dinner celebrating the medal recipients at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. Guests included baseball legend Hank Aaron, singer Aretha Franklin, civil rights leader John Lewis, and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Kennedy's grandson, Jack Schlossberg, was set to introduce Obama. Caroline Kennedy, Kennedy's daughter and the new U.S. ambassador to Japan, was also expected to attend.\n\nOn Friday, the anniversary of Kennedy's death, Obama planned to meet with Peace Corps leaders and volunteers, another program started by Kennedy. The Clintons' visit to Kennedy's grave also raised questions about whether Obama has a favorite for the 2016 presidential election, as Hillary Clinton is seen as a likely candidate. Vice President Joe Biden, another possible candidate, only attended the White House ceremony."

        "gpt": "WASHINGTON — People in Washington haven’t paid much attention to the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) for many years. This federal agency manages almost 200 schools for about 50,000 Native American children across 23 states. Many of these schools are in bad shape.\n\nNow, things might change. President Obama wants to add $150 million to the budget for Native American education. Nearly $60 million of this money would go toward repairing tribal school buildings that have been falling apart for decades. This is part of a bigger plan to help Native American children.\n\nRepresentative John Kline, a Republican from Minnesota, is also focusing on the problems in the BIE. He leads the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. Recently, he held two hearings to talk about the agency’s issues. After visiting a broken-down tribal school in his state, Kline asked other lawmakers to support the president’s funding request. He said Native American kids need safe schools to learn.\n\n\"You’ve got roofs falling in, wires sticking out, gas leaks, and freezing classrooms,\" Kline said at a May 14 hearing. \"Kids can’t learn well when they’re sitting in their coats and mittens, trying to stay warm.\"\n\nInterest in the BIE grew after a series of reports in the *Minneapolis Star Tribune* in late 2014. The series showed how bad the conditions are in many tribal schools. It said these schools send the wrong message to children about the importance of education. The series was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize.\n\nLast year, the government said about one-third of BIE schools were in bad condition. Fixing them would cost $1.3 billion. Another $1 billion is needed to catch up on repairs and maintenance.\n\nThe BIE has been reorganized many times. Its current director, Monty Roessel, is the 33rd leader in 36 years. Roessel says he is trying to fix two main problems: improving school buildings and teaching. He told lawmakers that if Congress approves the president’s 2016 budget request, the agency can fix schools that have been on a priority list since 2004. He also plans to create a new list of schools in need of repairs by this summer.\n\nRight now, 58 school buildings are in such bad condition that it’s cheaper to replace them than to repair them. “It’s one of our biggest frustrations,” Roessel said.\n\nThe Department of Defense also has schools that need repairs. In 2010, it started a $5 billion plan to fix or rebuild 47 of its schools by 2021. But over the last four years, the BIE received just $39 million for new schools — less than the cost of one Defense Department school.\n\nThe U.S. government promised to provide education for Native American children in treaties signed during the 19th century. But the BIE, which is part of the Interior Department, has struggled to keep this promise. Problems include not enough staff, frequent leadership changes, poor communication, and lack of accountability. Many tribal schools are also in remote, poor areas, which makes things harder.\n\nToday, only about 8 percent of Native American children go to BIE schools. These students score lower on most academic measures than Native American students in public schools — and they also score below the national average."

        "gpt": "BEIJING — People in northern China live 5.5 years less on average than those in the south. This is mainly because the air in the north is much dirtier, according to a new study based on 20 years of data.\n\nThe study, done by researchers from China, the U.S., and Israel, looked at air quality in 90 cities from 1981 to 2000. It also compared death rates in 145 places from 1991 to 2000. The results showed a strong link between dirty air and shorter lives.\n\nThe problem started with a policy from the Mao era. The government gave free coal for heating in the north but not in the south. Burning coal caused much more air pollution in the north. As a result, people in the north were exposed to far more harmful particles in the air, which hurt their health.\n\nThe researchers found that the air in northern China had 55% more harmful particles than the air in the south. These particles, called TSPs (total suspended particulates), are tiny pieces of pollution that can harm the heart and lungs. Because of this, life expectancy in the north was 5.5 years shorter, mainly due to heart and lung-related illnesses.\n\nIn the 1990s, about 500 million people lived in northern China. The study estimated that this pollution caused them to lose a total of 2.5 billion years of life. One of the researchers, Yuyu Chen from Peking University, said the findings show how serious the air pollution problem is. He called for stronger actions, like a \"clean air act\" for China.\n\nAir pollution is still a big problem in China today. In January, Beijing experienced some of its worst pollution ever, nicknamed the \"Airpocalypse.\" The thick smog disrupted travel, canceled outdoor activities, and sent many people to the hospital. In June, another bad pollution event hit the city.\n\nThese events have sparked debates about whether China’s rapid economic growth is worth the cost to people’s health. Protests over pollution have increased in recent years, and the government knows the issue could become a political problem. During the Airpocalypse, the government tried emergency measures, like cutting factory production and limiting car use. In June, officials announced 10 new anti-pollution rules, such as upgrading factories and publishing pollution data.\n\nOne of the rules requires companies to cut pollution per unit of output by 30% by 2017. But critics say this won’t make a big difference if the economy keeps growing fast. Chen said people would likely accept slower growth if it meant cleaner air and longer lives. For example, reducing pollution by 100 micrograms per cubic meter could add three years to life expectancy.\n\nThe study looked at older pollution data measured in the 1980s and '90s. Back then, scientists tracked larger particles called PM 10. Today, researchers focus on smaller particles called PM 2.5, which are even more dangerous because they can get deep into the lungs. In January, PM 2.5 levels in parts of northeastern China went over 1,000 micrograms per cubic meter. For comparison, the U.S. considers levels above 35 unhealthy, and most U.S. areas stay well below this limit.\n\nOther studies have also highlighted the deadly effects of air pollution in China. A report from 2012 found that PM 2.5 pollution caused over 8,500 early deaths in four major cities and cost more than $1 billion in economic losses. Another study estimated that air pollution caused 1.2 million premature deaths in China in 2010, nearly 40% of the global total.\n\nHongbin Li, another researcher, said stricter rules for factories, fuel, and heating are needed. While this would cost money and slow economic growth, it would save lives and reduce healthcare costs in the long run."

        "gpt": "FOWLER, Calif. — Shandeep Dhillon’s cousin had recently gotten married, which turned out to be very helpful.  \n\nThanks to the wedding, Shandeep had access to lots of fancy clothes for Fowler High School’s first Bollywood night. His uncle’s embroidered sherwani coat went to the school’s principal, Hank Gutierrez. Shandeep’s old outfit, which no longer fit him, went to the principal’s son, Jordan. Shandeep borrowed another cousin’s outfit, and so it went, with wedding clothes being shared.  \n\nPunjabi girls at the school also shared their colorful salvar kameez outfits with their Latina, Armenian, and Swedish classmates.  \n\n“We go to a lot of Indian weddings, and you feel like a princess when you dress up,” said Manpreet Shaliwal, 16, who wore a shiny, peacock-blue outfit. Girls who had never even talked to her before were now asking to borrow her clothes for the event.  \n\nThe school cafeteria was decorated beautifully. A ceiling covered with tulle — an idea from Pinterest — cost more than $200 but was worth it. Harcoover Singh Bhatti, the president of the Punjabi club, was thrilled.  \n\n“This was three years in the making. Three years!” the 18-year-old said, rushing around to check on the samosas. He wore his usual black turban and looked excited. “It’s a first!”  \n\nPrincipal Gutierrez, in sparkling slippers with curled-up toes, watched the busy scene.  \n\n“This is my favorite moment as principal,” he said. “I grew up in this small town, raised by a single mom. I wanted the school to feel like a family, where we create something special together.”  \n\nBut being a Sikh kid isn’t always easy.  \n\nA recent study by the Sikh Coalition showed that Sikh kids in Central California face some of the worst bullying in the country. Over half of Sikh students aged 12 to 18 said they had been bullied. For boys who wear turbans, the number was 67%, more than double the national average.  \n\nSikh boys and men often wear turbans because their religion teaches that all body hair is sacred and shouldn’t be cut. Sikhs have lived in California’s San Joaquin Valley for over 100 years, and the area is home to more than 30,000 Punjabi people. Sikh temples, called gurdwaras, are common in the area and always welcome everyone with free meals.  \n\n“People started looking at us differently after 9/11,” said Simran Kaur, a nursing student at a Sikh temple in Fresno.  \n\nKaur said she hasn’t experienced bullying herself. She has adapted to American culture by plucking her eyebrows and cutting layers into her hair. However, her husband, who wears a turban, has faced some incidents. Once, men called him a terrorist at his job. Another time, people tried to run them off the road, yelling “Muslims.”  \n\n“We’re not Muslim,” Kaur said. “It could have happened to anyone.”  \n\nBhatti, the student behind the Bollywood dance, was born in America. His mother, who came to the U.S. as part of an arranged marriage, worried about raising him here.  \n\n“She thought American kids were spoiled and sent me to India to learn respect for our culture,” Bhatti said.  \n\nAt age 6, Bhatti was sent to a boarding school in the Himalayas. He cried for the first year. The school was strict, with white uniforms, white towels, and a trunk to keep everything neat.  \n\nWhen he came back to Fowler for high school, Bhatti’s English was good on paper but not in conversations. His parents couldn’t afford a tutor, so he taught himself English over the summer. The next summer, he learned to swim and joined the mostly white swim team, surprising people who didn’t expect a Punjabi boy to swim.  \n\nLater, he joined the drama club and kept breaking stereotypes. Now, he’s been accepted to big universities and plans to become a doctor.  \n\nBut one incident in high school stayed with him. An elderly Sikh man, Piara Singh, was beaten outside a temple in what police called a hate crime. Bhatti spoke with Singh, who was shocked that such violence could happen in their community.  \n\nThis motivated Bhatti to make the Bollywood dance a reality. Some Sikh boys doubted the event, worrying people would mock it. But Bhatti was determined.  \n\n“I knew it was going to be epic,” he said.  \n\nOn the night of the event, after dinner and a performance by a Sikh dance group, students packed the dance floor. DJ Malhi played Jazzy B’s Punjabi music, and the energy was electric.  \n\nBhatti’s turban bobbed in the middle of the crowd. His best friend Caleb, a blond swimmer, joined in. A shy Sikh boy who usually kept his head down danced joyfully as classmates cheered.  \n\nIn a corner, teacher Anika Arya, the Punjabi club’s adviser, wiped away tears.  \n\n“It was just so moving,” she said."

        "gpt": "PHILADELPHIA — For people who usually talk about the beauty of flowers and growing vegetables, the message was surprising: \"Horticulture is in trouble.\"\n\nThis warning came in a letter written by six top plant experts. In December, they sent it to 800 schools, universities, government offices, and plant businesses. The letter said the field of horticulture is at risk of being forgotten. If more people don’t join the field, the art and science of growing plants could disappear.\n\nPaul B. Redman, head of Longwood Gardens in Pennsylvania, explained the problem. \"Horticulture has to compete with other careers. We need to make it more exciting and important,\" he said. The letter included a plan to fix this with three main steps:\n\n1. A study to show how serious the problem is.\n2. A plan to teach horticulture in schools and promote it in colleges.\n3. A marketing and awareness campaign to show why horticulture matters and what careers it offers.\n\nRedman said it’s urgent to act now. He’s worked in horticulture for 30 years and still finds people don’t understand what it is. That’s the first problem: What is horticulture?\n\nHorticulture is the art and science of growing fruits, vegetables, flowers, and decorative plants. But many people think it’s just about mowing lawns or doing simple gardening jobs. Mary H. Meyer, a professor at the University of Minnesota, says this is a misunderstanding. She explains that horticulture includes many careers, like breeding plants, running greenhouses, growing food, managing public parks, studying plant diseases, and even researching how plants help people feel better.\n\nThis issue isn’t just in the U.S. In England, known for its gardening, there’s also a shortage of skilled workers in horticulture. A report from the Royal Horticultural Society said this could harm the country’s economy, environment, and food supply.\n\nExperts say this problem has been building for years. Changes like global food trade and people moving from farms to cities mean fewer people are connected to the land. Richard Marini, head of plant science at Pennsylvania State University, says most people only care about plants after they buy a house, when it’s too late to study horticulture.\n\nYoung people like Matthew Bond, a plant sciences student at Cornell University, are concerned. Bond grew up in a farming area and loved gardening with his family. But he’s seen interest in youth gardening groups drop over the years. He thinks kids today are too busy and spend little time outside. Still, he’s hopeful because urban farming and organic food are becoming more popular among young people.\n\nAt Temple University, Pauline Hurley-Kurtz says interest in traditional horticulture is steady, but new areas like growing food, restoring landscapes, and urban gardening are growing fast. She believes these fields are the future, but says we still need experts in plant science.\n\nJessica McAtamney, a teacher at a Philadelphia high school, agrees. She says kids won’t find plant science exciting unless someone makes it fun for them. Once they’re interested, they love it.\n\nHydeia Brown, a 17-year-old student in Philadelphia, is a great example. She studies environmental science and plans to work with plants. She loves science and wishes more kids would explore the outdoors. \"A lot of kids just like electronics,\" she said.\n\nChanging how people see horticulture will take time, maybe 20 years. But experts believe it’s worth the effort. Douglas C. Needham from Longwood Gardens says, \"I’m passionate about this, and I don’t want to see horticulture disappear.\""

        "gpt": "If you want to help slow down climate change, eating white meat like chicken might be a better choice than beef. Two studies show how beef farming harms the environment much more than other types of meat.\n\nIn the U.S., raising cattle takes 28 times more land and 11 times more water than producing the same amount of food from dairy, chicken, pork, or eggs. It also releases at least five times more gases that warm the planet. This information comes from a study published in the journal *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.*\n\nAnother study, published in *Climatic Change*, found that from 1961 to 2010, gases from livestock farming increased by 51% worldwide. Most of this rise happened in developing countries, where people are eating more meat like in the U.S.\n\nGidon Eshel, the lead author of the first study, says, \"The best thing people can do is replace beef with other foods whenever possible. If you want to eat animal products, that's fine—just choose things like bacon, eggs, or chicken. Avoiding beef makes a big difference because it’s so much worse for the environment than other foods.\"\n\nThe beef industry disagrees. Kim Stackhouse-Lawson, from the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, said the first study oversimplifies the complicated beef production process. She also said the U.S. produces beef with fewer greenhouse gas emissions than any other country.\n\nThe second study found that emissions in developed countries, like the U.S., peaked in 1970 and dropped by 23% since then. But in developing countries, emissions more than doubled. This is mostly because more people in these countries are eating beef. Ken Caldeira, a co-author of the study, said that beef cattle create more than half of the emissions from livestock, followed by dairy cows, sheep, buffalo, pigs, and goats.\n\nCaldeira also said that many developing countries are copying the unhealthy eating habits of wealthier nations.\n\nThe first study focused on the U.S. food system and included more details, like the effects of grazing, growing animal feed, and using water for irrigation. However, the study admits there are some uncertainties. For example, the amount of feed animals need and how much pasture they eat can vary depending on location and farming practices.\n\nEshel hopes the study will influence not only what people eat but also government policies. For instance, he suggests charging fees for grazing cattle on public land. He said, \"When resources that belong to everyone are free, people don’t use them wisely. They waste them, as they have done in the past.\""

        "gpt": "THE HAGUE, Netherlands — Today, anyone with a smartphone can quickly take a selfie. But in the Dutch Golden Age, self-portraits were carefully made by skilled artists who spent a lot of time planning every detail.\n\nThe Mauritshuis museum is hosting an exhibition about these 17th-century self-portraits. It shows how they are both similar to and different from modern selfies.\n\nThe museum's director, Emilie Gordenker, said this is the first time such an exhibition has been done. The museum wanted to connect these old paintings to today's trend of taking selfies with phones and sharing them online.\n\nThe exhibition runs from October 8 to January 3. It includes 27 self-portraits by artists like Rembrandt, a master of self-portraits; his student Carel Fabritius, known for \"The Goldfinch\"; and Judith Leyster, whose self-portrait is borrowed from the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.\n\nOne of the paintings, by a lesser-known artist named Huygh Pietersz Voskuyl, is the centerpiece of the show. His 1638 self-portrait shows him looking over his shoulder, much like a modern selfie pose. Instead of using a smartphone, these artists used mirrors to create their self-portraits. The exhibition even includes large mirrors to reflect the paintings, making the experience feel interactive.\n\nWhile selfies and self-portraits are similar — both show the person who created them — they are very different in how they are made. Selfies are quick and often unplanned, but these paintings were carefully thought out. A video at the exhibition explains how much effort went into these works and offers tips for making better selfies today.\n\nVisitors are welcome to take selfies in the museum.\n\nVoskuyl’s painting is a great example of how much detail can be in a simple picture. Director Gordenker pointed out how Voskuyl included small details like the texture of his beard, embroidery on his shirt, and even a fake wood wall behind him. She said he put a lot of thought into showing textures and his personality. His painting also showed off his skill, acting as an advertisement for his talent.\n\nIn the 17th century, self-portraits were like business cards for artists. They showed not only what the artists looked like but also how skilled they were. Exhibition curator Ariane van Suchtelen explained that artists like Rembrandt were famous for their unique painting styles. Buying a self-portrait by Rembrandt gave people both a picture of the artist and an example of his amazing art."

        "gpt": "WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama said on Thursday that nearly 10,000 U.S. troops will stay in Afghanistan through most of next year. By 2017, when he leaves office, 5,500 troops will remain. This changes his earlier promise to end the war during his time as president. Instead, he will pass the conflict to the next leader.\n\nObama called this plan a \"modest but meaningful\" change to his original goal of ending the U.S. military's role in Afghanistan. He admitted that Americans are tired of the long war but said it is important to make this extra effort.\n\nFor months, military leaders have said Afghan forces need more U.S. help to fight the Taliban and keep the progress made over the last 14 years. Speaking at the White House, Obama said Afghan forces have improved but that the country’s security is still weak.\n\nAfter much discussion, Obama decided to keep 9,800 troops in Afghanistan through most of next year. In 2017, this number will go down to 5,500, but the exact timing will depend on advice from military leaders.\n\nIt will be up to the next president — the third U.S. leader to oversee this war — to decide what to do after 2017.\n\n“We will keep looking at this plan over time, as will the next president,” Obama said. He stood with Vice President Joe Biden, Defense Secretary Ash Carter, and Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nAfghanistan has not been talked about much in the 2016 presidential race so far. But Obama’s decision may push the candidates to share their own plans for the war they could take over.\n\nSome Republican candidates supported Obama’s move but also used it to criticize his foreign policy.\n\n“I think it’s the right thing to do,” said New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in a radio interview. But he added that pulling America back from world conflicts and allowing terrorist groups to grow is not a safe plan.\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said he was glad Obama changed his earlier plan to leave the region completely. However, he said Obama should give the military everything they need to succeed.\n\nA defense official said Obama approved the highest number of troops that military leaders asked for and gave them flexibility to act. The plan will continue two missions: fighting terrorists and training Afghan forces. U.S. troops will stay at key bases in Kabul, Bagram, Jalalabad, and Kandahar.\n\nObama will leave office with U.S. troops still active in both Afghanistan and Iraq. He had promised to remove U.S. forces from both countries. While most U.S. troops left Iraq in 2011, the rise of the Islamic State group brought them back to help local forces and carry out airstrikes. This mission, Obama said, will likely continue after his presidency.\n\nOn Thursday, Obama said he was not upset about not keeping his promise to withdraw all troops from Afghanistan. He said the situation in the country has changed since he made that promise more than two years ago. He also noted that the U.S. now has a better partner in Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, who replaced Hamid Karzai last year.\n\n“We can’t separate good government from good security,” Obama said.\n\nThe decision came after Taliban fighters recently took over the northern city of Kunduz. Afghan forces, with U.S. air support, fought to take back the city. During the fighting, a U.S. airstrike mistakenly hit a hospital, killing 12 staff members and 10 patients.\n\nU.S. commanders are also worried about Islamic State fighters moving into Afghanistan and recruiting members from the Taliban.\n\nTalks about keeping more troops in Afghanistan began in March when Afghan President Ghani visited Washington. Gen. John Campbell, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, gave Obama several options for keeping more troops. He said this was necessary to help the Afghan army and prevent the Taliban from regaining control.\n\nNATO allies support the U.S. decision to stay longer in Afghanistan, but no specific commitments from other countries were mentioned."

        "gpt": "WASHINGTON — Michelle Obama spoke on Tuesday about why arts are important in schools. She said arts should not wait until test scores improve. Instead, arts help students do better in school from the start.\n\nMrs. Obama shared this message at the first White House student talent show. The show featured songs and dances by kids from schools that had struggled. These schools are part of a new arts program to help them improve.\n\nBy the end of the fun-filled show in the East Room, Mrs. Obama joined the students on stage to dance. The last song of the show was inspired by President Obama's \"Yes We Can\" campaign slogan. Even President Obama stopped his work to watch, support arts education, and cheer on the students.\n\nThe show highlighted the \"Turnaround Arts\" program. This program started in 2012 to see if arts could help students do better in school. Famous artists worked with schools to support the program. Early results showed better reading and math scores, fewer behavior problems, and a happier school environment.\n\nMrs. Obama announced that the program is growing. It will now include 35 schools in 10 states and Washington, D.C., instead of just the original eight schools. Two of the first schools, one in Iowa and one in Boston, improved so much that they no longer need extra help.\n\nMrs. Obama explained why arts matter. She said arts make kids excited to come to school, whether it’s to act in a play or play an instrument. If kids aren’t in school, they can’t learn anything, she said. She also said arts aren’t something extra to add later. Arts are key to helping kids do better in school and life.\n\nPresident Obama agreed. He said arts are not just a nice thing but something kids need to succeed. \"The arts are part of who we are,\" he said. \"They help our kids succeed.\"\n\nFamous artists like Sarah Jessica Parker and Alfre Woodard performed with students. They also shared how arts have helped the students they work with. Woodard said arts give kids confidence, which helps them in all areas of life.\n\nStudents also shared their thoughts. Sinai Jones, an 8-year-old from Portland, said arts help kids dream about their future and feel more confident. She and her group, with Parker singing backup, performed a song from the musical \"Annie.\"\n\nThe program will get $5 million over the next three years from public and private groups, including the Education Department, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Ford Foundation."

She’s suing Pepperidge Farm, the company that makes Goldfish crackers, claiming they wrongly call their product “natural.” She says the crackers contain genetically modified soybeans, which are not natural.\n\nLisa, a teacher in Palm Beach County, filed the lawsuit on June 11 in federal court. She wants the court to let other people in Florida join her lawsuit, change the labels on the crackers, and pay at least $5 million to customers who bought the snacks since June 2009. She says the company broke Florida’s rules against unfair business practices.\n\nHer lawyer, Joshua Eggnatz, said, “People have the right to know what’s in their food. Some people don’t care about GMOs, but others do, and they should be able to choose.”\n\nGMOs, or genetically modified organisms, are plants or animals changed in a lab. Scientists add DNA from other plants, animals, or bacteria to make crops grow more, survive tough weather, or resist bugs. In the U.S., about 90% of crops like corn, soybeans, and sugar beets are genetically modified. These crops are often used in processed foods like crackers and cereals.\n\nThe FDA (Food and Drug Administration) hasn’t clearly defined what “natural” means for food labels. But it says foods can be called “natural” if they don’t have added colors, fake flavors, or man-made substances.\n\nLisa’s lawsuit says she bought Goldfish crackers every month at stores near her home. She paid extra because she believed the “natural” label meant the crackers didn’t have GMOs. If she had known, she would have chosen cheaper snacks without GMOs. The lawsuit doesn’t claim anyone in Lisa’s family got sick from eating the crackers.\n\nPepperidge Farm has not commented on the lawsuit.\n\nThis case is part of a bigger debate about GMOs and their effects on health. Some studies suggest GMOs might cause allergies or other problems, but the evidence isn’t clear. Over 60 countries, like Japan and those in the European Union, have banned or limited GMOs. Some U.S. lawmakers and states are pushing for labels to show if foods contain GMOs. Florida tried to pass a law about this in 2013, but it didn’t succeed.\n\nFood companies argue that labeling GMOs might make people wrongly think the foods are unsafe. Lillian Craggs-Dino, a dietitian, says the issue is complicated. Some GMOs use DNA from animals, which could cause problems for people with allergies or for those who are vegan or follow Kosher diets.\n\nCraggs-Dino and others believe consumers deserve clear labels to make informed choices. Whole Foods, a major grocery chain, has decided to require GMO labels on its products by 2018. Publix, another grocery store, is supporting efforts to educate people about GMOs.\n\nIf you want to avoid GMOs now, experts suggest buying organic food certified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Dietitian Carol Sherman adds, “Use common sense. Goldfish crackers are highly processed, so it’s not surprising they might have GMOs.”"

        "gpt": "LEEDS, Utah — Leeds is a tiny town along I-15 in southern Utah. It has nice views of red-rock hills but isn’t a big tourist spot. For many drivers, it’s just a stop on the way to bigger adventures.\n\nNearby, the speed limit on the highway changes from 75 to 80 miles per hour (mph) as you head north toward Provo, 250 miles away. This higher speed limit tempts many drivers to press the gas pedal harder and drive faster through the desert.\n\nYears ago, during an energy crisis, the national speed limit was set at 55 mph to save fuel. But now, cars are more fuel-efficient, and gas prices have stabilized. This has led to higher speed limits in many states. Some people love driving faster, while others are more cautious. Tony Bonny, a bartender from St. George, says, “I go 5 mph over the limit, but when I see the 80 sign, I speed up a little more.”\n\nAcross the U.S., speed limits are rising, especially in Western states with wide-open roads. However, safety experts worry this trend will cause more accidents and deaths. Speeding is already a factor in one-third of highway deaths in the U.S. each year. Russ Rader, from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, says, “Higher speeds get you places faster, but they also lead to more severe crashes and deaths. It’s simple physics.”\n\nSince 2005, 13 states have raised their speed limits, mostly to 70 or 75 mph. In the West, some states have gone further. Idaho and Wyoming now allow 80 mph on certain highways, and Montana is considering raising its limit to 85 mph, matching Texas for the highest speed limit in the country.\n\nFor some, the difference between 75 and 80 mph doesn’t seem big — it only saves about two hours on a cross-country trip. But many states say they’re not encouraging faster driving. They’re just setting limits closer to the speeds people already drive. Kara Macek, from the Governors Highway Safety Association, says peer pressure plays a role. “When one state raises its speed limit, others feel pressure to do the same.”\n\nIn Utah, crashes have actually dropped in areas where the speed limit was increased to 80 mph. Officials say this is because drivers follow the higher limit better than they did the old one. Recently, Utah also raised the speed limit from 65 to 70 mph on highways in urban areas like Salt Lake City. Officials say this change makes traffic flow more smoothly.\n\nBut not everyone agrees with raising speed limits. Safety experts say higher speeds are dangerous, especially in areas with pedestrians, bicyclists, and public transportation. For example, New York City recently lowered its speed limit from 30 to 25 mph to protect pedestrians. Russ Rader points out that 10,000 people die each year in speed-related crashes, which is far too many.\n\nSome drivers enjoy the freedom of higher speed limits. Robert Ehlert, a writer for the *Idaho Statesman*, says, “The 80 mph limit feels like freedom. This is the West — this is how we roll.” Truckers, like Jake Hansen, also find it helpful. Hansen, hauling steel beams to Salt Lake City, says, “I can get ahead of schedule. It makes a difference.”\n\nHowever, the trucking industry has called for a national speed limit of 65 mph. They also want trucks to have devices that prevent them from going faster. Sean McNally, from the American Trucking Association, says, “Speed increases risk and the severity of crashes.”\n\nThe Utah Highway Patrol also opposes higher speed limits. Sergeant Todd Royce says, “We see what happens in fatal crashes at high speeds. It’s not worth it.” On a recent day, Sergeant Jake Hicks sat in his patrol car near Leeds, watching drivers come down a steep mountain road. He has seen drivers going over 100 mph on this stretch. Although he lets small speeders slide, he has ticketed drivers for ridiculous excuses. One man said he was speeding to dry his car after washing it. Hicks told him, “That’s an expensive car wash.”\n\nHicks stopped another driver, Doug Griffin, for going 84 mph in his old Buick. Griffin said he was rushing to a meeting but admitted, “It didn’t work out. Everyone I passed just passed me while I waited on the side of the road.” He added, “I guess there’s no justice in speeding.”"

        "gpt": "WASHINGTON — First, a teenager survived a rare cancer. Then, she decided to study it. This led to a project that helped scientists find a strange gene problem that might explain how the tumor grows.\n\nAt just 18 years old, Elana Simon became an author of a study published in the famous journal *Science*. Her hard work is helping scientists learn more about this rare disease.\n\n\"It's crazy that I've been able to do this,\" said Elana, who lives in New York City. She wanted to study the rare liver cancer that mostly affects teens and young adults.\n\nTo make her idea happen, she got help from experienced scientists. Her father, who works in a lab at Rockefeller University, her surgeon at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and gene experts at the New York Genome Center all worked with her. Another cancer survivor, who chose not to share their name, also helped write the study.\n\nThe team discovered something unusual: A piece of genetic material broke and joined two genes together. This created an abnormal protein found in the tumors but not in healthy liver tissue. The researchers think this protein might help the cancer grow. So far, they've found this gene problem in all 15 tumors they tested.\n\nThe study is small, and more research is needed to understand this gene problem, said Dr. Sanford Simon, Elana’s father and the lead scientist on the study.\n\nElana's project has also inspired efforts to involve more patients in research. Scientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are helping the Simons create a patient registry. The NIH even shared a YouTube video where Elana and another survivor encourage others to join the research.\n\n\"Fibrolamellar Hepatocellular Carcinoma. Not easy to say. Not easy to understand,\" the video explains.\n\nElana was diagnosed with this cancer at age 12. Surgery is the only treatment that works, and her tumor was removed in time. But if the cancer spreads, there are few options. Elana knows other patients who weren’t as lucky.\n\nWhen she was in 10th grade, Elana had an internship where she used her computer skills to help researchers study genetic mutations in a different type of cancer.\n\nShe wondered, why not try the same thing for her own rare liver cancer?\n\nThe problem was finding enough tumor samples to study. Only about 200 people worldwide are diagnosed with this cancer each year, according to the Fibrolamellar Cancer Foundation, which helped fund the study. No one had been keeping tissue samples from surgeries.\n\nElana’s surgeon, Dr. Michael LaQuaglia, offered to help. Elana also spread the word to patient groups. Soon, samples started arriving. Elana used her computer skills to help analyze the tumor cells.\n\nAt the New York Genome Center, scientists used a program called FusionCatcher to find the strange mutation. Other researchers then showed that the abnormal protein is active in the tumor cells.\n\nDr. Sanford Simon said it’s an exciting time for young people to explore science because computers make so much research possible.\n\nAs for Elana, she plans to study computer science at Harvard next fall."

        "gpt": "MEXICO CITY — In a corner of Alejandra Pinzon's room, there’s a pink drawer. It’s almost hidden under a pile of clothes. But when she opens it, she finds her most precious things. These are items that remind her of a life she feels she is losing.\n\nInside are photos from her Kansas high school homecoming, a letter from her aunt in Overland Park, a report card with mostly A’s, and her SAT scores, which she’s never read. There are also gold tickets from a Taylor Swift concert. She smiles as she looks at them. \n\n\"I’m obsessed with Taylor Swift,\" she says. \"I wish she’d come to Mexico.\"\n\nIn 2010, just months after the concert, while her friends were planning prom, Alejandra had to make a big decision. She was living in the United States without papers and was about to graduate high school. She wanted to go to college, but that didn’t seem possible. She worried about being deported. Her choice was to stay and live in fear or return to Mexico, go to college, and hope to one day return to the U.S. legally. She thought it might take four or five years.\n\nIt didn’t go as planned.\n\nAlejandra’s story is one of thousands. Immigration debates in the U.S. often focus on politics, but they deeply affect young people like her. These young people are stuck between two countries, not fully belonging to one or the other. Experts call this feeling the “borderlands.”\n\nFrom 2005 to 2010, about 500,000 young Mexicans ages 15 to 32 returned to Mexico from the U.S. Some returned with their families; others were deported. Alejandra, now 21, is one of them. She lives in Mexico City but feels connected to the American Midwest where she grew up. \n\nAlejandra’s family is divided. Her sister Lulu, a U.S. citizen, lives in St. Louis. Another sister, Gaby, lives in Mexico City. Alejandra was brought to the U.S. at age 11 by her father. They overstayed their tourist visas and lived with her grandmother in Kansas. Alejandra went to middle school and high school there, where she joined clubs, danced on the drill team, and made many friends. She loved American life, especially going to the mall and eating at Red Robin.\n\nBut in 2010, Alejandra decided to return to Mexico before she turned 18 to avoid immigration trouble. Her sister Lulu tried to stop her. \"You don’t know what you’re doing,\" Lulu warned. But Alejandra believed it was the best choice.\n\nWhen she arrived in Mexico City, it felt like a foreign country. She barely spoke Spanish and spent hours on Facebook and Skype talking to her friends in the U.S. She eventually met others who had also returned from the U.S., many after being deported. These new friends understood her homesickness.\n\nAlejandra tried to enroll in college in Mexico, but it was hard. The government wouldn’t accept her U.S. high school diploma because of a name issue. She was told she’d have to wait until she turned 21 to take an equivalency test. Frustrated by the endless paperwork, she gave up and got a job at a call center. There, she took calls from U.S. customers. One day, she spoke with a woman from her old town in Kansas. They chatted about places they both knew. \"Don’t you love Overland Park?\" Alejandra asked.\n\nIn 2012, Alejandra learned about the DREAM Act, which protected young immigrants like her in the U.S. from deportation. She realized that if she had stayed, she could have applied. Instead, she was stuck in Mexico. \"What have I done?\" she thought.\n\nAlejandra fell into a deep sadness. Her sister Gaby worried she might try to return to the U.S. illegally. Alejandra admits that she has thought about it. She still has her tourist visa and even a plane ticket her sister Lulu bought for her. But she’s unsure if she’s ready to leave her family in Mexico again.\n\nFor now, Alejandra hopes to take the high school equivalency test when she turns 21 and go to college in Mexico. She dreams of earning a degree and finding a way to return to the U.S. legally. But she knows it won’t be easy.\n\n\"I’m always going to think about going back,\" she says. In her room, near the pink drawer filled with her American memories, she keeps the plane ticket. It’s a reminder of the life she left behind."

        "gpt": "WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court decided on Monday to cancel a law that would have let Americans born in Jerusalem list \"Israel\" as their birthplace on U.S. passports. This decision highlights the president's special role in handling foreign affairs.\n\nThe court voted 6-3, saying Congress went too far when it passed the law in 2002. The law would have forced the U.S. State Department to change its long-standing rule of not listing Israel as the birthplace for people born in Jerusalem.\n\nThis rule exists because the U.S. government does not officially recognize any country as owning Jerusalem. The city's status is meant to be decided in peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nJustice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the majority opinion that only the president has the power to officially recognize foreign countries. Deciding what goes on passports is part of that power. \"The nation must speak with one voice on this issue, and that voice belongs to the president,\" Kennedy said.\n\nThis decision ends a 12-year legal battle brought by Menachem Zivotofsky, who was born in Jerusalem, and his parents.\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia disagreed with the decision and read his opinion aloud in court. He argued that the Constitution splits foreign policy powers between Congress and the president. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito agreed with Scalia. Roberts also warned that this ruling could set a dangerous example by letting the president ignore a law passed by Congress.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas agreed with the final decision but for different, narrower reasons.\n\nThe case was decided during a time of tension between Israelis and Palestinians over Jerusalem. There were also disagreements between Israel and the U.S., with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticizing the U.S. over its talks with Iran about nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, President Barack Obama criticized Netanyahu for rejecting the idea of a Palestinian state during his re-election campaign.\n\nThe status of Jerusalem has been a difficult issue for decades. Israel has controlled all of Jerusalem since the Six-Day War in 1967 and calls it its capital. Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of their future state.\n\nJustice Kennedy acknowledged the sensitive nature of the case, saying, \"Jerusalem is a delicate topic.\"\n\nThe court's four liberal justices, including its three Jewish members, joined Kennedy in siding with the Obama administration against the Zivotofskys.\n\nThe U.S. has long avoided recognizing any country as owning Jerusalem, saying the city's status should be decided through peace talks. For years, Congress has tried to push presidents to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, but no president has done so. The law about listing Israel on passports, passed in 2002, has never been enforced.\n\nThe Supreme Court had looked at this case once before, in 2012. Back then, it told lower courts they could not treat the issue as only political. Later, a federal appeals court ruled that the law was unconstitutional because it interfered with the president's power over foreign affairs.\n\nFor decades, Congress and the White House have disagreed about how to handle Jerusalem. In 1995, Congress supported Israel's position, saying the U.S. should recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. In 2002, Congress passed a law urging the president to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and let people born in Jerusalem list Israel as their birthplace. However, both President George W. Bush and President Obama refused to change U.S. policy on Jerusalem.\n\nIsrael's government did not comment on the Supreme Court's decision. A Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Israel does not respond to rulings made by other countries' courts."

        "gpt": "WASHINGTON—President Barack Obama announced new steps on Tuesday to protect parts of the world's oceans. This includes creating a marine sanctuary in the central Pacific, where fishing and energy development will not be allowed.\n\nThe plan asks federal agencies to take action against pollution, overfishing, and ocean acidification, which happens because of climate change.\n\n\"Carbon dioxide is making our oceans more acidic. Pollution harms marine life. Overfishing puts entire species at risk,\" Obama said in a speech at an international ocean policy conference in Washington, D.C. \"If we ignore these problems, we will lose one of the world's greatest treasures. We will also harm a major source of food and jobs.\"\n\nThis decision shows Obama is willing to use his powers as president to push his goals, even when Congress is stuck in disagreement. Some Republicans criticized the move, saying the president is overstepping his authority and adding too many rules.\n\n\"This is another example of the president acting alone, without input from Congress,\" said Congressman Doc Hastings. \"Oceans, like federal lands, should be used for many purposes, including fishing, energy production, and conservation.\"\n\nOne of the biggest changes in the plan is expanding the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument near Hawaii. In 2009, President George W. Bush protected 87,000 square miles around several uninhabited islands and reefs. These areas are home to many birds, fish, and marine animals, and are some of the most untouched ocean environments in the world.\n\nObama’s proposal would expand the protected area from 50 miles around the islands to 200 miles. This would stop fishing and energy development in a much larger area. Environmental groups say this could more than double the amount of U.S.-protected ocean.\n\nThe president can make this change without Congress, but there will be a public comment period before it becomes final.\n\nJoshua Reichert, from the Pew Charitable Trusts, said the tuna industry might oppose the plan. However, he said only a small part of the U.S. tuna catch—about 1 to 3 percent—would be affected. Reichert added that protecting these areas is more important than the short-term value of fishing there.\n\nObama also created a task force with at least 12 federal agencies to fight seafood fraud and illegal fishing. This group will make recommendations within six months. Studies show that up to one-third of seafood sold in the U.S. is mislabeled, and much of it is caught illegally.\n\n\"Seafood fraud happens because our supply chain is long and complicated,\" said Beth Lowell from Oceana, an environmental group. \"By tracking seafood from the boat to the plate, consumers will know more about the fish they buy.\"\n\nThe plan also aims to study ocean acidification more closely. Oceans absorb about 25 percent of the carbon dioxide released by human activities. This makes the water more acidic, which harms marine life, like coral reefs and shellfish. For example, oyster farms in the Pacific Northwest have been affected.\n\nUnder the plan, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will get $9 million over three years to study how acidification affects coastal areas. This research could help local communities deal with the problem."
